           In addition to standard Git revision specifiers (revspecs),
           patches may be of a stack. If no branch is specified, the current
           branch is used by default. The parent of a patch may be specified
           with [<branch>:]<patch>^.
## OPTIONS         top
           -b <branch>, --branch=<branch>
               Use <branch> instead of current branch
