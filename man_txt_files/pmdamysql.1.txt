## NAME         top
           pmdamysql - MySQL and MariaDB database PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdamysql is a Performance Co-Pilot PMDA which extracts live
           performance data from a running MySQL or MariaDB database.
## INSTALLATION         top
           pmdamysql uses a configuration file from (in this order):
           •   /etc/pcpdbi.conf
           •   $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mysql/mysql.conf
           This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the
           settings listed at the start of pmdamysql.pl, namely:
           •   database name (see DBI(3) for details, default is
               "DBI:mysql:mysql")
           •   database username (default is "dbmonitor")
           •   database password (default is "dbmonitor")
           •   login account (default is "pcp")
           On some versions of MariaDB (10+) the performance schema is
           disabled by default, and must be enabled for the PMDA to
           function.  This is achieved by adding the string
           "performance_schema" into the "[mysqld]" section of the MariaDB
           configuration file (either my.cnf or my.ini).  The "SHOW ENGINES"
           SQL statement shows support for the performance schema.
           Once these initial setup actions are complete, you can access the
           names and values for the mysql performance metrics by doing the
           following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mysql
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mysql
               # ./Remove
           pmdamysql is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## Binary Status values in text         top
           Some of the status values are in the form of YES/NO or ON/OFF.
           Since these cannot be interpreted by tools like pmie(1), they
           have been duplicated with a _num extension and the values of 1
           (YES/ON) or 0 (NO/OFF).
       Eg:
           •   mysql.slave_status.slave_io_running
           •   mysql.slave_status.slave_io_running_num
## FILES         top
           /etc/pcpdbi.conf
               configuration file for all PCP database monitors
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mysql/mysql.conf
               configuration file for pmdamysql
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mysql/Install
               installation script for the pmdamysql agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mysql/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdamysql agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mysql.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdamysql
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
