## NAME         top
           cg_annotate - post-processing tool for Cachegrind
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cg_annotate [options] cachegrind-out-file [source-files...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           cg_annotate takes one or more Cachegrind output files and prints
           data about the profiled program in an easy-to-read form.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h --help
               Show the help message.
           --version
               Show the version number.
           --diff
               Diff two Cachegrind output files.
           --mod-filename <regex> [default: none]
               Specifies an s/old/new/ search-and-replace expression that is
               applied to all filenames. Useful when differencing, for
               removing minor differences in paths between two different
               versions of a program that are sitting in different
               directories. An i suffix makes the regex case-insensitive,
               and a g suffix makes it match multiple times.
           --mod-funcname <regex> [default: none]
               Like --mod-filename, but for filenames. Useful for removing
               minor differences in randomized names of auto-generated
               functions generated by some compilers.
           --show=A,B,C [default: all, using order in the Cachegrind output
           file]
               Specifies which events to show (and the column order).
               Default is to use all present in the Cachegrind output file
               (and use the order in the file). Best used in conjunction
               with --sort.
           --sort=A,B,C [default: order in the Cachegrind output file]
               Specifies the events upon which the sorting of the
               file:function and function:file entries will be based.
           --threshold=X [default: 0.1%]
               Sets the significance threshold for the file:function and
               function:files sections. A file or function is shown if it
               accounts for more than X% of the counts for the primary sort
               event. If annotating source files, this also affects which
               files are annotated.
           --show-percs, --no-show-percs, --show-percs=<no|yes> [default:
           yes]
               When enabled, a percentage is printed next to all event
               counts. This helps gauge the relative importance of each
               function and line.
           --annotate, --no-annotate, --auto=<no|yes> [default: yes]
               Enables or disables source file annotation.
           --context=N [default: 8]
               The number of lines of context to show before and after each
               annotated line. Use a large number (e.g. 100000) to show all
               source lines.
