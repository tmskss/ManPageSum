    MESG(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               MESG(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           mesg — permit or deny messages
## SYNOPSIS         top
           mesg [y|n]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The mesg utility shall control whether other users are allowed to
           send messages via write, talk, or other utilities to a terminal
           device. The terminal device affected shall be determined by
           searching for the first terminal in the sequence of devices
           associated with standard input, standard output, and standard
           error, respectively. With no arguments, mesg shall report the
           current state without changing it. Processes with appropriate
           privileges may be able to send messages to the terminal
           independent of the current state.
## OPTIONS         top
           None.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported in the POSIX locale:
           y         Grant permission to other users to send messages to the
                     terminal device.
           n         Deny permission to other users to send messages to the
                     terminal device.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           mesg:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written (by
                     mesg) to standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           If no operand is specified, mesg shall display the current
           terminal state in an unspecified format.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Receiving messages is allowed.
            1    Receiving messages is not allowed.
           >1    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           The mechanism by which the message status of the terminal is
           changed is unspecified. Therefore, unspecified actions may cause
           the status of the terminal to change after mesg has successfully
           completed. These actions may include, but are not limited to:
           another invocation of the mesg utility, login procedures;
           invocation of the stty utility, invocation of the chmod utility
           or chmod() function, and so on.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           The terminal changed by mesg is that associated with the standard
           input, output, or error, rather than the controlling terminal for
           the session. This is because users logged in more than once
           should be able to change any of their login terminals without
           having to stop the job running in those sessions.  This is not a
           security problem involving the terminals of other users because
           appropriate privileges would be required to affect the terminal
           of another user.
           The method of checking each of the first three file descriptors
           in sequence until a terminal is found was adopted from System V.
           The file /dev/tty is not specified for the terminal device
           because it was thought to be too restrictive. Typical environment
           changes for the n operand are that write permissions are removed
           for others and group from the appropriate device. It was decided
           to leave the actual description of what is done as unspecified
           because of potential differences between implementations.
           The format for standard output is unspecified because of
           differences between historical implementations. This output is
           generally not useful to shell scripts (they can use the exit
           status), so exact parsing of the output is unnecessary.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
