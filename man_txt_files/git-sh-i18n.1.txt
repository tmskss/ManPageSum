## NAME         top
           git-sh-i18n - Git's i18n setup code for shell scripts
## SYNOPSIS         top
           . "$(git --exec-path)/git-sh-i18n"
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
           documentation is meant for people who are studying the
           Porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones.
           The 'git sh-i18n scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .) by
           Git’s porcelain programs implemented in shell script. It provides
           wrappers for the GNU gettext and eval_gettext functions
           accessible through the gettext.sh script, and provides
           pass-through fallbacks on systems without GNU gettext.
## FUNCTIONS         top
           gettext
               Currently a dummy fall-through function implemented as a
               wrapper around printf(1). Will be replaced by a real gettext
               implementation in a later version.
           eval_gettext
               Currently a dummy fall-through function implemented as a
               wrapper around printf(1) with variables expanded by the
               git-sh-i18n--envsubst(1) helper. Will be replaced by a real
               gettext implementation in a later version.
