           perf-buildid-list - List the buildids in a perf.data file
## SYNOPSIS         top
           perf buildid-list <options>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This command displays the buildids found in a perf.data file, so
           that other tools can be used to fetch packages with matching
           symbol tables for use by perf report.
           It can also be used to show the build id of the running kernel or
           in an ELF file using -i/--input.
## OPTIONS         top
           -H, --with-hits
               Show only DSOs with hits.
           -i, --input=
               Input file name. (default: perf.data unless stdin is a fifo)
           -f, --force
               Don’t do ownership validation.
           -k, --kernel
               Show running kernel build id.
           -m, --kernel-maps
               Show buildid, start/end text address, and path of running
               kernel and its modules.
           -v, --verbose
               Be more verbose.
