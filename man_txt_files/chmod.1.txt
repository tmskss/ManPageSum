## NAME         top
           chmod - change file mode bits
## SYNOPSIS         top
           chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
           chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
           chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This manual page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod
           changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode,
           which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make,
           or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode
           bits.
           The format of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...],
           where perms is either zero or more letters from the set rwxXst,
           or a single letter from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic modes can
           be given, separated by commas.
           A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to
           the file will be changed: the user who owns it (u), other users
           in the file's group (g), other users not in the file's group (o),
           or all users (a).  If none of these are given, the effect is as
           if (a) were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not
           affected.
           The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to
           the existing file mode bits of each file; - causes them to be
           removed; and = causes them to be added and causes unmentioned
           bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user
           and group ID bits are not affected.
           The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users:
           read (r), write (w), execute (or search for directories) (x),
           execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has
           execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on
           execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).
           Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly
           one of the letters ugo: the permissions granted to the user who
           owns the file (u), the permissions granted to other users who are
           members of the file's group (g), and the permissions granted to
           users that are in neither of the two preceding categories (o).
           A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by
           adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are
           assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set
           user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted deletion or
           sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for
           the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1);
           the third selects permissions for other users in the file's
           group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not
           in the file's group, with the same values.
           chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod
           system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a
           problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.
           However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, chmod
           changes the permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast,
           chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive
           directory traversals.
## SETUID AND SETGID BITS         top
           chmod clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's
           group ID does not match the user's effective group ID or one of
           the user's supplementary group IDs, unless the user has
           appropriate privileges.  Additional restrictions may cause the
           set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored.
           This behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the
           underlying chmod system call.  When in doubt, check the
           underlying system behavior.
           For directories chmod preserves set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits
           unless you explicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or clear
           the bits with symbolic modes like u+s and g-s.  To clear these
           bits for directories with a numeric mode requires an additional
           leading zero like 00755, leading minus like -6000, or leading
           equals like =755.
## RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT         top
           The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose
           interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it
           prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in
           the directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is
           called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and is
           commonly found on world-writable directories like /tmp.  For
           regular files on some older systems, the bit saves the program's
           text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when
           run; this is called the sticky bit.
## OPTIONS         top
           Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With --reference, change
           the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.
           -c, --changes
                  like verbose but report only when a change is made
           -f, --silent, --quiet
                  suppress most error messages
           -v, --verbose
                  output a diagnostic for every file processed
           --no-preserve-root
                  do not treat '/' specially (the default)
           --preserve-root
                  fail to operate recursively on '/'
           --reference=RFILE
                  use RFILE's mode instead of specifying MODE values.  RFILE
                  is always dereferenced if a symbolic link.
           -R, --recursive
                  change files and directories recursively
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           Each MODE is of the form
           '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.
