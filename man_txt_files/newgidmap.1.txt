    NEWGIDMAP(1)                  User Commands                 NEWGIDMAP(1)
## NAME         top
           newgidmap - set the gid mapping of a user namespace
## SYNOPSIS         top
           newgidmap pid gid lowergid count [gid lowergid count [ ... ]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The newgidmap sets /proc/[pid]/gid_map based on its command line
           arguments and the gids allowed. Subgid delegation can either be
           managed via /etc/subgid or through the configured NSS subid
           module. These options are mutually exclusive.
           Note that the root group is not exempted from the requirement for
           a valid /etc/subgid entry.
           After the pid argument, newgidmap expects sets of 3 integers:
           gid
               Beginning of the range of GIDs inside the user namespace.
           lowergid
               Beginning of the range of GIDs outside the user namespace.
           count
               Length of the ranges (both inside and outside the user
               namespace).
           newgidmap verifies that the caller is the owner of the process
           indicated by pid and that for each of the above sets, each of the
           GIDs in the range [lowergid, lowergid+count) is allowed to the
           caller according to /etc/subgid before setting
           /proc/[pid]/gid_map.
           Note that newgidmap may be used only once for a given process.
           Instead of an integer process id, the first argument may be
           specified as fd:N, where the integer N is the file descriptor
           number for the calling process's opened file for /proc/[pid[. In
           this case, newgidmap will use openat(2) to open the gid_map file
           under that directory, avoiding a TOCTTOU in case the process
           exits and the pid is immediately reused.
## OPTIONS         top
           There currently are no options to the newgidmap command.
## FILES         top
           /etc/subgid
               List of user's subordinate group IDs.
           /proc/[pid]/gid_map
               Mapping of gids from one between user namespaces.
