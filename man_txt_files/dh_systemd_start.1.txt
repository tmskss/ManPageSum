## NAME         top
           dh_systemd_start - start/stop/restart systemd unit files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_systemd_start [debhelper options] [--restart-after-upgrade]
           [--no-stop-on-upgrade] [unit file ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_systemd_start is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           starting/stopping or restarting systemd unit files in case no
           corresponding sysv init script is available.
           As with dh_installinit, the unit file is stopped before upgrades
           and started afterwards (unless --restart-after-upgrade is
           specified, in which case it will only be restarted after the
           upgrade).  This logic is not used when there is a corresponding
           SysV init script because invoke-rc.d performs the
           stop/start/restart in that case.
## OPTIONS         top
           --restart-after-upgrade
               Do not stop the unit file until after the package upgrade has
               been completed.  This is the default behaviour in compat 10.
               In earlier compat levels the default was to stop the unit
               file in the prerm, and start it again in the postinst.
               This can be useful for daemons that should not have a
               possibly long downtime during upgrade. But you should make
               sure that the daemon will not get confused by the package
               being upgraded while it's running before using this option.
           --no-restart-after-upgrade
               Undo a previous --restart-after-upgrade (or the default of
               compat 10).  If no other options are given, this will cause
               the service to be stopped in the prerm script and started
               again in the postinst script.
           -r, --no-stop-on-upgrade, --no-restart-on-upgrade
               Do not stop service on upgrade.
           --no-start
               Do not start the unit file after upgrades and after initial
               installation (the latter is only relevant for services
               without a corresponding init script).
## NOTES         top
           Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
           called between invocations of this command (with the same
           arguments). Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the
           same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
           Note that dh_systemd_start should be run after dh_installinit so
           that it can detect corresponding SysV init scripts. The default
           sequence in dh does the right thing, this note is only relevant
           when you are calling dh_systemd_start manually.
