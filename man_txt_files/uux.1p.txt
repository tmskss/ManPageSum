## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           uux — remote command execution
## SYNOPSIS         top
           uux [-jnp] command-string
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The uux utility shall gather zero or more files from various
           systems, execute a shell pipeline (see Section 2.9, Shell
           Commands) on a specified system, and then send the standard
           output of the command to a file on a specified system. Only the
           first command of a pipeline can have a system-name!  prefix. All
           other commands in the pipeline shall be executed on the system of
           the first command.
           The following restrictions are applicable to the shell pipeline
           processed by uux:
            *  In gathering files from different systems, pathname expansion
               shall not be performed by uux.  Thus, a request such as:
                   uux "c99 remsys!~/*.c"
               would attempt to copy the file named literally *.c to the
               local system.
            *  The redirection operators ">>", "<<", ">|", and ">&" shall
               not be accepted. Any use of these redirection operators shall
               cause this utility to write an error message describing the
               problem and exit with a non-zero exit status.
            *  The reserved word !  cannot be used at the head of the
               pipeline to modify the exit status.  (See the command-string
               operand description below.)
            *  Alias substitution shall not be performed.
           A filename can be specified as for uucp; it can be an absolute
           pathname, a pathname preceded by ~name (which is replaced by the
           corresponding login directory), a pathname specified as ~/dest
           (dest is prefixed by the public directory called PUBDIR; the
           actual location of PUBDIR is implementation-defined), or a simple
           filename (which is prefixed by uux with the current directory).
           See uucp(1p) for the details.
           The execution of commands on remote systems shall take place in
           an execution directory known to the uucp system. All files
           required for the execution shall be put into this directory
           unless they already reside on that machine. Therefore, the
           application shall ensure that non-local filenames (without path
           or machine reference) are unique within the uux request.
           The uux utility shall attempt to get all files to the execution
           system. For files that are output files, the application shall
           ensure that the filename is escaped using parentheses.
           The remote system shall notify the user by mail if the requested
           command on the remote system was disallowed or the files were not
           accessible. This notification can be turned off by the -n option.
           Typical implementations of this utility require a communications
           line configured to use the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface, but other
           communications means may be used. On systems where there are no
           available communications means (either temporarily or
           permanently), this utility shall write an error message
           describing the problem and exit with a non-zero exit status.
           The uux utility cannot guarantee support for all character
           encodings in all circumstances. For example, transmission data
           may be restricted to 7 bits by the underlying network, 8-bit data
           and filenames need not be portable to non-internationalized
           systems, and so on. Under these circumstances, it is recommended
           that only characters defined in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
           International Reference Version (equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range
           of characters be used and that only characters defined in the
           portable filename character set be used for naming files.
## OPTIONS         top
           The uux utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -j        Write the job identification string to standard output.
                     This job identification can be used by uustat to obtain
                     the status or terminate a job.
           -n        Do not notify the user if the command fails.
           -p        Make the standard input to uux the standard input to
                     the command-string.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           command-string
                     A string made up of one or more arguments that are
                     similar to normal command arguments, except that the
                     command and any filenames can be prefixed by system-
                     name!.  A null system-name shall be interpreted as the
                     local system.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall not be used unless the '-' or -p option
           is specified; in those cases, the standard input shall be made
           the standard input of the command-string.
## INPUT FILES         top
           Input files shall be selected according to the contents of
           command-string.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           uux:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The standard output shall not be used unless the -j option is
           specified; in that case, the job identification string shall be
           written to standard output in the following format:
               "%s\n", <jobid>
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           Output files shall be created or written, or both, according to
           the contents of command-string.
           If -n is not used, mail files shall be modified following any
           command or file-access failures on the remote system.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           This utility is part of the UUCP Utilities option and need not be
           supported by all implementations.
           Note that, for security reasons, many installations limit the
           list of commands executable on behalf of an incoming request from
           uux.  Many sites permit little more than the receipt of mail via
           uux.
           Any characters special to the command interpreter should be
           quoted either by quoting the entire command-string or quoting the
           special characters as individual arguments.
           As noted in uucp, shell pattern matching notation characters
           appearing in pathnames are expanded on the appropriate local
           system. This is done under the control of local settings of
           LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE.  Thus, care should be taken when using
           bracketed filename patterns, as collation and typing rules may
           vary from one system to another. Also be aware that certain types
           of expression (that is, equivalence classes, character classes,
           and collating symbols) need not be supported on non-
           internationalized systems.
## EXAMPLES         top
            1. The following command gets file1 from system a and file2 from
               system b, executes diff on the local system, and puts the
               results in file.diff in the local PUBDIR directory. (PUBDIR
               is the uucp public directory on the local system.)
                   uux "!diff a!/usr/file1 b!/a4/file2 >!~/file.diff"
            2. The following command fails because uux places all files
               copied to a system in the same working directory.  Although
               the files xyz are from two different systems, their filenames
               are the same and conflict.
                   uux "!diff a!/usr1/xyz b!/usr2/xyz >!~/xyz.diff"
            3. The following command succeeds (assuming diff is permitted on
               system a) because the file local to system a is not copied to
               the working directory, and hence does not conflict with the
               file from system c.
                   uux "a!diff a!/usr/xyz c!/usr/xyz >!~/xyz.diff"
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
