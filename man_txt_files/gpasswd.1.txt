    GPASSWD(1)                    User Commands                   GPASSWD(1)
## NAME         top
           gpasswd - administer /etc/group and /etc/gshadow
## SYNOPSIS         top
           gpasswd [option] group
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The gpasswd command is used to administer /etc/group, and
           /etc/gshadow. Every group can have administrators, members and a
           password.
           System administrators can use the -A option to define group
           administrator(s) and the -M option to define members. They have
           all rights of group administrators and members.
           gpasswd called by a group administrator with a group name only
           prompts for the new password of the group.
           If a password is set the members can still use newgrp(1) without
           a password, and non-members must supply the password.
       Notes about group passwords
           Group passwords are an inherent security problem since more than
           one person is permitted to know the password. However, groups are
           a useful tool for permitting co-operation between different
           users.
## OPTIONS         top
           Except for the -A and -M options, the options cannot be combined.
           The options which apply to the gpasswd command are:
           -a, --add user
               Add the user to the named group.
           -d, --delete user
               Remove the user from the named group.
           -h, --help
               Display help message and exit.
           -Q, --root CHROOT_DIR
               Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the
               configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR directory. Only
               absolute paths are supported.
           -r, --remove-password
               Remove the password from the named group. The group password
               will be empty. Only group members will be allowed to use
               newgrp to join the named group.
           -R, --restrict
               Restrict the access to the named group. The group password is
               set to "!". Only group members with a password will be
               allowed to use newgrp to join the named group.
           -A, --administrators user,...
               Set the list of administrative users.
           -M, --members user,...
               Set the list of group members.
## CAVEATS         top
           This tool only operates on the /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files.
           Thus you cannot change any NIS or LDAP group. This must be
           performed on the corresponding server.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
           the behavior of this tool:
           ENCRYPT_METHOD (string)
               This defines the system default encryption algorithm for
               encrypting passwords (if no algorithm are specified on the
               command line).
               It can take one of these values: DES (default), MD5, SHA256,
               SHA512. MD5 and DES should not be used for new hashes, see
               crypt(5) for recommendations.
               Note: this parameter overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB variable.
               Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The
               generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to
               the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
               consistently with the PAM configuration.
           MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number)
               Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached,
               a new group entry (line) is started in /etc/group (with the
               same name, same password, and same GID).
               The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in
               the number of members in a group.
               This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of
               lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that
               lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters.
               If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.
               Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in
               the Shadow toolsuite). You should not use this variable
               unless you really need it.
           MD5_CRYPT_ENAB (boolean)
               Indicate if passwords must be encrypted using the MD5-based
               algorithm. If set to yes, new passwords will be encrypted
               using the MD5-based algorithm compatible with the one used by
               recent releases of FreeBSD. It supports passwords of
               unlimited length and longer salt strings. Set to no if you
               need to copy encrypted passwords to other systems which don't
               understand the new algorithm. Default is no.
               This variable is superseded by the ENCRYPT_METHOD variable or
               by any command line option used to configure the encryption
               algorithm.
               This variable is deprecated. You should use ENCRYPT_METHOD.
               Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The
               generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to
               the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
               consistently with the PAM configuration.
           SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS (number), SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS (number)
               When ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512, this defines
               the number of SHA rounds used by the encryption algorithm by
               default (when the number of rounds is not specified on the
               command line).
               With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute forcing
               the password. But note also that more CPU resources will be
               needed to authenticate users.
               If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of
               rounds (5000), which is orders of magnitude too low for
               modern hardware.
               The values must be inside the 1000-999,999,999 range.
               If only one of the SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS or
               SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS values is set, then this value will be
               used.
               If SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS > SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS, the highest
               value will be used.
               Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The
               generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to
               the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable
               consistently with the PAM configuration.
