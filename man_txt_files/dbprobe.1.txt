## NAME         top
           dbprobe - database response time and availability information
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dbprobe.pl [delay]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The dbprobe utility is used by pmdadbping(1) to measure response
           time from a database.  A given query is executed on the database
           at the requested interval (delay, which defaults to 60 seconds).
           This response time measure can be exported via the Performance
           Co-Pilot framework for live and historical monitoring using
           pmdadbping(1).
