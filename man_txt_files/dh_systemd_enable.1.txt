## NAME         top
           dh_systemd_enable - enable/disable systemd unit files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_systemd_enable [debhelper options] [--no-enable] [--name=name]
           [unit file ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_systemd_enable is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           enabling and disabling systemd unit files.
           In the simple case, it finds all unit files installed by a
           package (e.g.  bacula-fd.service) and enables them. It is not
           necessary that the machine actually runs systemd during package
           installation time, enabling happens on all machines in order to
           be able to switch from sysvinit to systemd and back.
           In the complex case, you can call dh_systemd_enable and
           dh_systemd_start manually (by overwriting the debian/rules
           targets) and specify flags per unit file. An example is colord,
           which ships colord.service, a dbus-activated service without an
           [Install] section. This service file cannot be enabled or
           disabled (a state called "static" by systemd) because it has no
           [Install] section. Therefore, running dh_systemd_enable does not
           make sense.
           For only generating blocks for specific service files, you need
           to pass them as arguments, e.g. dh_systemd_enable quota.service
           and dh_systemd_enable --name=quotarpc quotarpc.service.

           debian/package.service, debian/package@.service
               If this exists, it is installed into

               lib/systemd/system/package@.service) in the package build
               directory.
           debian/package.tmpfile
               If this exists, it is installed into
               usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/package.conf in the package build
               directory.
           debian/package.target, debian/package@.target
               If this exists, it is installed into
               lib/systemd/system/package.target (or
               lib/systemd/system/package@.target) in the package build
               directory.
           debian/package.socket, debian/package@.socket
               If this exists, it is installed into

               lib/systemd/system/package@.socket) in the package build
               directory.
           debian/package.mount
               If this exists, it is installed into
               lib/systemd/system/package.mount in the package build
               directory.
           debian/package.path, debian/package@.path
               If this exists, it is installed into
               lib/systemd/system/package.path (or
               lib/systemd/system/package@.path) in the package build
               directory.
           debian/package.timer, debian/package@.timer
               If this exists, it is installed into
               lib/systemd/system/package.timer (or
               lib/systemd/system/package@.timer) in the package build
               directory.
## OPTIONS         top
           --no-enable
               Disable the service(s) on purge, but do not enable them on
               install.
               Note that this option does not affect whether the services
               are started.  That is controlled by dh_systemd_start(1)
               (using e.g. its --no-start option).
           --name=name
               Install the service file as name.service instead of the
               default filename, which is the package.service. When this
               parameter is used, dh_systemd_enable looks for and installs
               files named debian/package.name.service instead of the usual
               debian/package.service.
## NOTES         top
           Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
           called between invocations of this command (with the same
           arguments). Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the
           same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
           Note that dh_systemd_enable should be run before dh_installinit.
           The default sequence in dh does the right thing, this note is
           only relevant when you are calling dh_systemd_enable manually.
