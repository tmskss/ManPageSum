## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp2xlsx is a customizable performance metrics exporter tool from
           PCP to XLSX.  Any available performance metric, live or archived,
           system and/or application, can be selected for exporting using
           either command line arguments or a configuration file.
           pcp2xlsx is a close relative of pmrep(1).  Refer to pmrep(1) for
           the metricspec description accepted on pcp2xlsx command line.
           See pmrep.conf(5) for description of the pcp2xlsx.conf
           configuration file syntax.  This page describes pcp2xlsx specific
           options and configuration file differences with pmrep.conf(5).
           pmrep(1) also lists some usage examples of which most are
           applicable with pcp2xlsx as well.
           Only the command line options listed on this page are supported,
           other options available for pmrep(1) are not supported.
           Options via environment values (see pmGetOptions(3)) override the
           corresponding built-in default values (if any).  Configuration
           file options override the corresponding environment variables (if
           any).  Command line options override the corresponding
           configuration file options (if any).
## CONFIGURATION FILE         top
           pcp2xlsx uses a configuration file with syntax described in
           pmrep.conf(5).  The following options are common with pmrep.conf:
           version, source, speclocal, derived, header, globals, samples,
           interval, type, type_prefer, ignore_incompat, names_change,
           instances, omit_flat, include_labels, precision, precision_force,
           count_scale, count_scale_force, space_scale, space_scale_force,
           time_scale, time_scale_force.  The rest of the pmrep.conf options
           are recognized but ignored for compatibility.
       pcp2xlsx specific options
           None.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -0 precision, --precision-force=precision
                Like -P but this option will override per-metric
                specifications.
           -4 action, --names-change=action
                Specify which action to take on receiving a metric names
                change event during sampling.  These events occur when a
                PMDA discovers new metrics sometime after starting up, and
                informs running client tools like pcp2xlsx.  Valid values
                for action are update (refresh metrics being sampled),
                ignore (do nothing - the default behaviour) and abort (exit
                the program if such an event occurs).
           -5, --ignore-unknown
                Silently ignore any metric name that cannot be resolved.  At
                least one metric must be found for the tool to start.
           -a archive, --archive=archive
                Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
                Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log files identified by
                the archive argument, which is a comma-separated list of
                names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
                the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
           -A align, --align=align
                Force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a
                natural time unit align.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
                complete description of the syntax for align.
           --archive-folio=folio
                Read metric source archives from the PCP archive folio
                created by tools like pmchart(1) or, less often, manually
                with mkaf(1).
           -b scale, --space-scale=scale
                Unit/scale for space (byte) metrics, possible values include
                bytes, Kbytes, KB, Mbytes, MB, and so forth.  This option
                will not override possible per-metric specifications.  See
                also pmParseUnitsStr(3).
           -B scale, --space-scale-force=scale
                Like -b but this option will override per-metric
                specifications.
           -c config, --config=config
                Specify the config file or directory to use.  In case config
                is a directory all files in it ending .conf will be
                included.  The default is the first found of:
                ./pcp2xlsx.conf, $HOME/.pcp2xlsx.conf,
                $HOME/pcp/pcp2xlsx.conf, and $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pcp2xlsx.conf.
                For details, see the above section and pmrep.conf(5).
           --container=container
                Fetch performance metrics from the specified container,
                either local or remote (see -h).
           -C, --check
                Exit before reporting any values, but after parsing the
                configuration and metrics and printing possible headers.
           --daemonize
                Daemonize on startup.
           -e derived, --derived=derived
                Specify derived performance metrics.  If derived starts with
                a slash (``/'') or with a dot (``.'') it will be interpreted
                as a PCP derived metrics configuration file, otherwise it
                will be interpreted as comma- or semicolon-separated derived
                metric expressions.  For complete description of derived
                metrics and PCP derived metrics configuration files see
                pmLoadDerivedConfig(3) and pmRegisterDerived(3).
                Alternatively, using pmrep.conf(5) configuration syntax
                allows defining derived metrics as part of metricsets.
           -G, --no-globals
                Do not include global metrics in reporting (see
                pmrep.conf(5)).
           -f format, --timestamp-format=format
                Use the format string for formatting the timestamp.  The
                format will be used with Python's datetime.strftime method
                which is mostly the same as that described in strftime(3).
                The default is %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.
           -F outfile, --output-file=outfile
                Specify the output file outfile.
           -h host, --host=host
                Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather than
                from the default localhost.
           -H, --no-header
                Do not print any headers.
           -i instances, --instances=instances
                Retrieve and report only the specified metric instances from
                currently present metric instances.  By default all current
                instances are reported.
                Refer to pmrep(1) for complete description of this option.
           -I, --ignore-incompat
                Ignore incompatible metrics.  By default incompatible
                metrics (that is, their type is unsupported or they cannot
                be scaled as requested) will cause pcp2xlsx to terminate
                with an error message.  With this option all incompatible
                metrics are silently omitted from reporting.  This may be
                especially useful when requesting non-leaf nodes of the PMNS
                tree for reporting.
           -K spec, --spec-local=spec
                When fetching metrics from a local context (see -L), the -K
                option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
                made accessible.  The spec argument conforms to the syntax
                described in pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).  More than one -K option
                may be used.
           -L, --local-PMDA
                Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the
                local host without PMCD.  See also -K.
           -m, --include-labels
                Include PCP metric labels in the output.
           -O origin, --origin=origin
                When reporting archived metrics, start reporting at origin
                within the time window (see -S and -T).  Refer to
                PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the syntax for
                origin.
           -P precision, --precision=precision
                Use precision for numeric non-integer output values.  The
                default is to use 3 decimal places (when applicable).  This
                option will not override possible per-metric specifications.
           -q scale, --count-scale=scale
                Unit/scale for count metrics, possible values include count
                x 10^-1, count, count x 10, count x 10^2, and so forth from
                10^-8 to 10^7.  (These values are currently space-
                sensitive.)  This option will not override possible per-
                metric specifications.  See also pmParseUnitsStr(3).
           -Q scale, --count-scale-force=scale
                Like -q but this option will override per-metric
                specifications.
           -r, --raw
                Output raw metric values, do not convert cumulative counters
                to rates.  This option will override possible per-metric
                specifications.
           -R, --raw-prefer
                Like -r but this option will not override per-metric
                specifications.
           -s samples, --samples=samples
                The samples argument defines the number of samples to be
                retrieved and reported.  If samples is 0 or -s is not
                specified, pcp2xlsx will sample and report continuously (in
                real time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives
                (in archive mode).  See also -T.
           -S starttime, --start=starttime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged at or after starttime.
                Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
                syntax for starttime.
           -t interval, --interval=interval
                Set the reporting interval to something other than the
                default 1 second.  The interval argument follows the syntax
                described in PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest form may be an
                unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are
                seconds).  See also the -T option.
           -T endtime, --finish=endtime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged before or at endtime.
                Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
                syntax for endtime.
                When used to define the runtime before pcp2xlsx will exit,
                if no samples is given (see -s) then the number of reported
                samples depends on interval (see -t).  If samples is given
                then interval will be adjusted to allow reporting of samples
                during runtime.  In case all of -T, -s, and -t are given,
                endtime determines the actual time pcp2xlsx will run.
           -v, --omit-flat
                Report only set-valued metrics with instances (e.g.
                disk.dev.read) and omit single-valued ``flat'' metrics
                without instances (e.g.  kernel.all.sysfork).  See -i and
                -I.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -y scale, --time-scale=scale
                Unit/scale for time metrics, possible values include
                nanosec, ns, microsec, us, millisec, ms, and so forth up to
                hour, hr.  This option will not override possible per-metric
                specifications.  See also pmParseUnitsStr(3).
           -Y scale, --time-scale-force=scale
                Like -y but this option will override per-metric
                specifications.
           -z, --hostzone
                Use the local timezone of the host that is the source of the
                performance metrics, as identified by either the -h or the
                -a options.  The default is to use the timezone of the local
                host.
           -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
                Use timezone for the date and time.  Timezone is in the
                format of the environment variable TZ as described in
                environ(7).  Note that when including a timezone string in
                output, ISO 8601 -style UTC offsets are used (so something
                like -Z EST+5 will become UTC-5).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.

           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
