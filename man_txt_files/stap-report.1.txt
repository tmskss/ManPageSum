## NAME         top
           stap-report - collect system information that is useful for
           debugging systemtap bugs
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stap-report
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The stap-report executable collects system information that is
           useful for debugging systemtap bugs. It is a good idea to include
           such a report in bug reports especially if you send them directly
           to the upstream. stap-report can be run either as a normal user
           or as root. The report will be more complete if stap-report is
           run as root.
## EXAMPLES         top
                  $ stap-report > report.txt
                  $ head report.txt
