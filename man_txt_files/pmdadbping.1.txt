## NAME         top
           pmdadbping - database response time and availability PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdadbping is a database response time measurement PMDA.
           pmdadbping runs dbprobe(1), and exports the performance
           measurements it makes available as PCP metrics.
           dbprobe(1) should be configured to use the type of DBI
           appropriate for the local database, which includes: RDBMS
           flavour, user/password, delay between "ping" requests, and the
           SQL statement to use.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Configure dbprobe(1) - it uses a configuration file from (in this
           order):
           •   /etc/pcpdbi.conf
           •   $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/dbprobe.conf
           This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the
           settings listed at the start of dbprobe.pl, namely:
           •   database name (see DBI(3) for details)
           •   database user name
           •   database pass word
           •   SQL statement to measure (probe)
           •   delay between probes
           Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
           dbping performance metrics by doing the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping
               # ./Remove
           pmdadbping is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/dbprobe.conf
               probe configuration file for dbprobe(1), used indirectly by
               pmdadbping
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/Install
               installation script for the pmdadbping agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdadbping agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/dbping.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdadbping
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
