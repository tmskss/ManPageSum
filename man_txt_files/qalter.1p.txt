           qalter — alter batch job
## SYNOPSIS         top
           qalter [-a date_time] [-A account_string] [-c interval] [-e path_name]
               [-h hold_list] [-j join_list] [-k keep_list] [-l resource_list]

## DESCRIPTION         top
           The attributes of a batch job are altered by a request to the
           batch server that manages the batch job. The qalter utility is a
           user-accessible batch client that requests the alteration of the
           attributes of one or more batch jobs.
           The qalter utility shall alter the attributes of those batch
           jobs, and only those batch jobs, for which a batch job_identifier
           is presented to the utility.
           The qalter utility shall alter the attributes of batch jobs in
           the order in which the batch job_identifiers are presented to the
           utility.
           If the qalter utility fails to process a batch job_identifier
           successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
           batch job_identifiers, if any.
           For each batch job_identifier for which the qalter utility
           succeeds, each attribute of the identified batch job shall be
           altered as indicated by all the options presented to the utility.
           For each identified batch job for which the qalter utility fails,
           the utility shall not alter any attribute of the batch job.
           For each batch job that the qalter utility processes, the utility
           shall not modify any attribute other than those required by the
           options and option-arguments presented to the utility.
           The qalter utility shall alter batch jobs by sending a Modify Job
           Request to the batch server that manages each batch job. At the
           time the qalter utility exits, it shall have modified the batch
           job corresponding to each successfully processed batch
           job_identifier.  An attempt to alter the attributes of a batch
           job in the RUNNING state is implementation-defined.
## OPTIONS         top
           The qalter utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
           -a date_time
                     Redefine the time at which the batch job becomes
                     eligible for execution.
                     The date_time argument shall be in the same form and
                     represent the same time as for the touch utility. The
                     time so represented shall be set into the
                     Execution_Time attribute of the batch job. If the time
                     specified is earlier than the current time, the -a
                     option shall have no effect.
           -A account_string
                     Redefine the account to which the resource consumption
                     of the batch job should be charged.
                     The syntax of the account_string option-argument is
                     unspecified.
                     The qalter utility shall set the Account_Name attribute
                     of the batch job to the value of the account_string
                     option-argument.
           -c interval
                     Redefine whether the batch job should be checkpointed,
                     and if so, how often.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a value for the
                     interval option-argument that is one of the following:
                     n         No checkpointing is to be performed on the
                               batch job (NO_CHECKPOINT).
                     s         Checkpointing is to be performed only when
                               the batch server is shut down
                               (CHECKPOINT_AT_SHUTDOWN).
                     c         Automatic periodic checkpointing is to be
                               performed at the Minimum_Cpu_Interval
                               attribute of the batch queue, in units of CPU
                               minutes (CHECKPOINT_AT_MIN_CPU_INTERVAL).
                     c=minutes Automatic periodic checkpointing is to be
                               performed every minutes of CPU time, or every
                               Minimum_Cpu_Interval minutes, whichever is
                               greater. The minutes argument shall conform
                               to the syntax for unsigned integers and shall
                               be greater than zero.
                     An implementation may define other checkpoint
                     intervals. The conformance document for an
                     implementation shall describe any alternative
                     checkpoint intervals, how they are specified, their
                     internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of
                     the utility.
                     The qalter utility shall set the Checkpoint attribute
                     of the batch job to the value of the interval option-
                     argument.
           -e path_name
                     Redefine the path to be used for the standard error
                     stream of the batch job.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a path_name option-
                     argument that conforms to the syntax of the path_name
                     element defined in the System Interfaces volume of
                     POSIX.1‐2017, which can be preceded by a host name
                     element of the form hostname:.
                     If the path_name option-argument constitutes an
                     absolute pathname, the qalter utility shall set the
                     Error_Path attribute of the batch job to the value of
                     the path_name option-argument, including the host name
                     element, if present.
                     If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
                     pathname and no host name element is specified, the
                     qalter utility shall set the Error_Path attribute of
                     the batch job to the value of the absolute pathname
                     derived by expanding the path_name option-argument
                     relative to the current directory of the process that
                     executes the qalter utility.
                     If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
                     pathname and a host name element is specified, the
                     qalter utility shall set the Error_Path attribute of
                     the batch job to the value of the option-argument
                     without expansion.
                     If the path_name option-argument does not include a
                     host name element, the qalter utility shall prefix the
                     pathname in the Error_Path attribute with hostname:,
                     where hostname is the name of the host upon which the
                     qalter utility is being executed.
           -h hold_list
                     Redefine the types of holds, if any, on the batch job.
                     The qalter -h option shall accept a value for the
                     hold_list option-argument that is a string of
                     alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a value for the
                     hold_list option-argument that is a string of one or
                     more of the characters 'u', 's', or 'o', or the single
                     character 'n'.  For each unique character in the
                     hold_list option-argument, the qalter utility shall add
                     a value to the Hold_Types attribute of the batch job as
                     follows, each representing a different hold type:
                     u     USER
                     s     SYSTEM
                     o     OPERATOR
                     If any of these characters are duplicated in the
                     hold_list option-argument, the duplicates shall be
                     ignored. An existing Hold_Types attribute can be
                     cleared by the hold type:
                     n     NO_HOLD
                     The qalter utility shall consider it an error if any
                     hold type other than 'n' is combined with hold type
                     'n'.  Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat
                     any of the characters 'u', 's', 'o', or 'n' within the
                     hold_list option-argument. The qalter utility shall
                     permit the repetition of characters, but shall not
                     assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.
                     An implementation may define other hold types. The
                     conformance document for an implementation shall
                     describe any additional hold types, how they are
                     specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                     the behavior of the utility.
           -j join_list
                     Redefine which streams of the batch job are to be
                     merged. The qalter -j option shall accept a value for
                     the join_list option-argument that is a string of
                     alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a join_list option-
                     argument that consists of one or more of the characters
                     'e' and 'o', or the single character 'n'.
                     All of the other batch job output streams specified
                     shall be merged into the output stream represented by
                     the character listed first in the join_list option-
                     argument.
                     For each unique character in the join_list option-
                     argument, the qalter utility shall add a value to the
                     Join_Path attribute of the batch job as follows, each
                     representing a different batch job stream to join:
                     e     The standard error of the batch job
                           (JOIN_STD_ERROR).
                     o     The standard output of the batch job
                           (JOIN_STD_OUTPUT).
                     An existing Join_Path attribute can be cleared by the
                     join type:
                     n     NO_JOIN
                     If 'n' is specified, then no files are joined. The
                     qalter utility shall consider it an error if any join
                     type other than 'n' is combined with join type 'n'.
                     Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                     of the characters 'e', 'o', or 'n' within the join_list
                     option-argument. The qalter utility shall permit the
                     repetition of characters, but shall not assign
                     additional meaning to the repeated characters.
                     An implementation may define other join types. The
                     conformance document for an implementation shall
                     describe any additional batch job streams, how they are
                     specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                     the behavior of the utility.
           -k keep_list
                     Redefine which output of the batch job to retain on the
                     execution host.
                     The qalter -k option shall accept a value for the
                     keep_list option-argument that is a string of
                     alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a keep_list option-
                     argument that consists of one or more of the characters
                     'e' and 'o', or the single character 'n'.
                     For each unique character in the keep_list option-
                     argument, the qalter utility shall add a value to the
                     Keep_Files attribute of the batch job as follows, each
                     representing a different batch job stream to keep:
                     e     The standard error of the batch job
                           (KEEP_STD_ERROR).
                     o     The standard output of the batch job
                           (KEEP_STD_OUTPUT).
                     If both 'e' and 'o' are specified, then both files are
                     retained. An existing Keep_Files attribute can be
                     cleared by the keep type:
                     n     NO_KEEP
                     If 'n' is specified, then no files are retained. The
                     qalter utility shall consider it an error if any keep
                     type other than 'n' is combined with keep type 'n'.
                     Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                     of the characters 'e', 'o', or 'n' within the keep_list
                     option-argument. The qalter utility shall permit the
                     repetition of characters, but shall not assign
                     additional meaning to the repeated characters. An
                     implementation may define other keep types. The
                     conformance document for an implementation shall
                     describe any additional keep types, how they are
                     specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                     the behavior of the utility.
           -l resource_list
                     Redefine the resources that are allowed or required by
                     the batch job.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a resource_list option-
                     argument that conforms to the following syntax:
                         resource=value[,,resource=value,,...]
                     The qalter utility shall set one entry in the value of
                     the Resource_List attribute of the batch job for each
                     resource listed in the resource_list option-argument.
                     Because the list of supported resource names might vary
                     by batch server, the qalter utility shall rely on the
                     batch server to validate the resource names and
                     associated values. See Section 3.3.3, Multiple Keyword-
                     Value Pairs for a means of removing keyword=value (and
                     value@keyword) pairs and other general rules for list-
                     oriented batch job attributes.
           -m mail_options
                     Redefine the points in the execution of the batch job
                     at which the batch server is to send mail about a
                     change in the state of the batch job.
                     The qalter -m option shall accept a value for the
                     mail_options option-argument that is a string of
                     alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a value for the
                     mail_options option-argument that is a string of one or
                     more of the characters 'e', 'b', and 'a', or the single
                     character 'n'.  For each unique character in the
                     mail_options option-argument, the qalter utility shall
                     add a value to the Mail_Users attribute of the batch
                     job as follows, each representing a different time
                     during the life of a batch job at which to send mail:
                     e     MAIL_AT_EXIT
                     b     MAIL_AT_BEGINNING
                     a     MAIL_AT_ABORT
                     If any of these characters are duplicated in the
                     mail_options option-argument, the duplicates shall be
                     ignored.
                     An existing Mail_Points attribute can be cleared by the
                     mail type:
                     n     NO_MAIL
                     If 'n' is specified, then mail is not sent. The qalter
                     utility shall consider it an error if any mail type
                     other than 'n' is combined with mail type 'n'.
                     Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                     of the characters 'e', 'b', 'a', or 'n' within the
                     mail_options option-argument. The qalter utility shall
                     permit the repetition of characters but shall not
                     assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.
                     An implementation may define other mail types. The
                     conformance document for an implementation shall
                     describe any additional mail types, how they are
                     specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                     the behavior of the utility.
           -M mail_list
                     Redefine the list of users to which the batch server
                     that executes the batch job is to send mail, if the
                     batch server sends mail about the batch job.
                     The syntax of the mail_list option-argument is
                     unspecified. If the implementation of the qalter
                     utility uses a name service to locate users, the
                     utility shall accept the syntax used by the name
                     service.
                     If the implementation of the qalter utility does not
                     use a name service to locate users, the implementation
                     shall accept the following syntax for user names:
                         mail_address[,,mail_address,,...]
                     The interpretation of mail_address is implementation-
                     defined.
                     The qalter utility shall set the Mail_Users attribute
                     of the batch job to the value of the mail_list option-
                     argument.
           -N name   Redefine the name of the batch job.
                     The qalter -N option shall accept a value for the name
                     option-argument that is a string of up to 15
                     alphanumeric characters in the portable character set
                     where the first character is alphabetic.
                     The syntax of the name option-argument is unspecified.
                     The qalter utility shall set the Job_Name attribute of
                     the batch job to the value of the name option-argument.
           -o path_name
                     Redefine the path for the standard output of the batch
                     job.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a path_name option-
                     argument that conforms to the syntax of the path_name
                     element defined in the System Interfaces volume of
                     POSIX.1‐2017, which can be preceded by a host name
                     element of the form hostname:.
                     If the path_name option-argument constitutes an
                     absolute pathname, the qalter utility shall set the
                     Output_Path attribute of the batch job to the value of
                     the path_name option-argument.
                     If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
                     pathname and no host name element is specified, the
                     qalter utility shall set the Output_Path attribute of
                     the batch job to the absolute pathname derived by
                     expanding the path_name option-argument relative to the
                     current directory of the process that executes the
                     qalter utility.
                     If the path_name option-argument constitutes a relative
                     pathname and a host name element is specified, the
                     qalter utility shall set the Output_Path attribute of
                     the batch job to the value of the path_name option-
                     argument without any expansion of the pathname.
                     If the path_name option-argument does not include a
                     host name element, the qalter utility shall prefix the
                     pathname in the Output_Path attribute with hostname:,
                     where hostname is the name of the host upon which the
                     qalter utility is being executed.
           -p priority
                     Redefine the priority of the batch job.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a value for the
                     priority option-argument that conforms to the syntax
                     for signed decimal integers, and which is not less than
                     -1024 and not greater than 1023.
                     The qalter utility shall set the Priority attribute of
                     the batch job to the value of the priority option-
                     argument.
           -r y|n    Redefine whether the batch job is rerunnable.
                     If the value of the option-argument is 'y', the qalter
                     utility shall set the Rerunable attribute of the batch
                     job to TRUE.
                     If the value of the option-argument is 'n', the qalter
                     utility shall set the Rerunable attribute of the batch
                     job to FALSE.
                     The qalter utility shall consider it an error if any
                     character other than 'y' or 'n' is specified in the
                     option-argument.
           -S path_name_list
                     Redefine the shell that interprets the script at the
                     destination system.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a path_name_list
                     option-argument that conforms to the following syntax:
                         pathname[@host][,pathname[@host],...]
                     The qalter utility shall accept only one pathname that
                     is missing a corresponding host name. The qalter
                     utility shall allow only one pathname per named host.
                     The qalter utility shall add a value to the
                     Shell_Path_List attribute of the batch job for each
                     entry in the path_name_list option-argument. See
                     Section 3.3.3, Multiple Keyword-Value Pairs for a means
                     of removing keyword=value (and value@keyword) pairs and
                     other general rules for list-oriented batch job
                     attributes.
           -u user_list
                     Redefine the user name under which the batch job is to
                     run at the destination system.
                     The qalter utility shall accept a user_list option-
                     argument that conforms to the following syntax:
                         username[@host][,,username[@host],,...]
                     The qalter utility shall accept only one user name that
                     is missing a corresponding host name. The qalter
                     utility shall accept only one user name per named host.
                     The qalter utility shall add a value to the User_List
                     attribute of the batch job for each entry in the
                     user_list option-argument. See Section 3.3.3, Multiple
                     Keyword-Value Pairs for a means of removing
                     keyword=value (and value@keyword) pairs and other
                     general rules for list-oriented batch job attributes.
## OPERANDS         top
           The qalter utility shall accept one or more operands that conform
           to the syntax for a batch job_identifier (see Section 3.3.1,
           Batch Job Identifier).
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           qalter:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           LOGNAME   Determine the login name of the user.
           TZ        Determine the timezone used to interpret the date-time
                     option-argument. If TZ is unset or null, an unspecified
                     default timezone shall be used.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           None.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           In addition to the default behavior, the qalter utility shall not
           be required to write a diagnostic message to standard error when
           the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the
           batch job_identifier does not exist on the server. Whether or not
           the qalter utility attempts to locate the batch job on other
           batch servers is implementation-defined.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           The qalter utility allows users to change the attributes of a
           batch job.
           As a means of altering a queued job, the qalter utility is
           superior to deleting and requeuing the batch job insofar as an
           altered job retains its place in the queue with some traditional
           selection algorithms. In addition, the qalter utility is both
           shorter and simpler than a sequence of qdel and qsub utilities.
           The result of an attempt on the part of a user to alter a batch
           job in a RUNNING state is implementation-defined because a batch
           job in the RUNNING state will already have opened its output
           files and otherwise performed any actions indicated by the
           options in effect at the time the batch job began execution.
           The options processed by the qalter utility are identical to
           those of the qsub utility, with a few exceptions: -V, -v, and -q.
           The -V and -v are inappropriate for the qalter utility, since
           they capture potentially transient environment information from
           the submitting process. The -q option would specify a new queue,
           which would largely negate the previously stated advantage of
           using qalter; furthermore, the qmove utility provides a superior
           means of moving jobs.
           Each of the following paragraphs provides the rationale for a
           qalter option.
           Additional rationale concerning these options can be found in the
           rationale for the qsub utility.
           The -a option allows users to alter the date and time at which a
           batch job becomes eligible to run.
           The -A option allows users to change the account that will be
           charged for the resources consumed by the batch job. Support for
           the -A option is mandatory for conforming implementations of
           qalter, even though support of accounting is optional for
           servers. Whether or not to support accounting is left to the
           implementor of the server, but mandatory support of the -A option
           assures users of a consistent interface and allows them to
           control accounting on servers that support accounting.
           The -c option allows users to alter the checkpointing interval of
           a batch job. A checkpointing system, which is not defined by
           POSIX.1‐2008, allows recovery of a batch job at the most recent
           checkpoint in the event of a crash. Checkpointing is typically
           used for jobs that consume expensive computing time or must meet
           a critical schedule. Users should be allowed to make the tradeoff
           between the overhead of checkpointing and the risk to the timely
           completion of the batch job; therefore, this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017 provides the checkpointing interval option. Support
           for checkpointing is optional for servers.
           The -e option allows users to alter the name and location of the
           standard error stream written by a batch job. However, the path
           of the standard error stream is meaningless if the value of the
           Join_Path attribute of the batch job is TRUE.
           The -h option allows users to set the hold type in the Hold_Types
           attribute of a batch job. The qhold and qrls utilities add or
           remove hold types to the Hold_Types attribute, respectively. The
           -h option has been modified to allow for implementation-defined
           hold types.
           The -j option allows users to alter the decision to join (merge)
           the standard error stream of the batch job with the standard
           output stream of the batch job.
           The -l option allows users to change the resource limits imposed
           on a batch job.
           The -m option allows users to modify the list of points in the
           life of a batch job at which the designated users will receive
           mail notification.
           The -M option allows users to alter the list of users who will
           receive notification about events in the life of a batch job.
           The -N option allows users to change the name of a batch job.
           The -o option allows users to alter the name and path to which
           the standard output stream of the batch job will be written.
           The -P option allows users to modify the priority of a batch job.
           Support for priority is optional for batch servers.
           The -r option allows users to alter the rerunability status of a
           batch job.
           The -S option allows users to change the name and location of the
           shell image that will be invoked to interpret the script of the
           batch job. This option has been modified to allow a list of shell
           name and locations associated with different hosts.
           The -u option allows users to change the user identifier under
           which the batch job will execute.
           The job_identifier operand syntax is provided so that the user
           can differentiate between the originating and destination (or
           executing) batch server. These may or may not be the same. The
           .server_name portion identifies the originating batch server,
           while the @server portion identifies the destination batch
           server.
           Historically, the qalter utility has been a component of the
           Network Queuing System (NQS), the existing practice from which
           this utility has been derived.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           The qalter utility may be removed in a future version.
