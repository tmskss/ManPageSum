## NAME         top
           dpkg-scansources - create Sources index files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dpkg-scansources [option...] binary-dir [override-file [path-
           prefix]] > Sources
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dpkg-scansources scans the given binary-dir for .dsc files.
           These are used to create a Debian source index, which is output
           to stdout.
           The override-file, if given, is used to set priorities in the
           resulting index stanzas and to override the maintainer field
           given in the .dsc files.  The file can be compressed (since dpkg
           1.15.5).  See deb-override(5) for the format of this file.
           Note: Since the override file is indexed by binary, not source
           packages, there's a bit of a problem here. The current
           implementation uses the highest priority of all the binary
           packages produced by a .dsc file for the priority of the source
           package, and the override entry for the first binary package
           listed in the .dsc file to modify maintainer information. This
           might change.
           The path-prefix, if given, is prepended to the directory field in
           the generated source index. You generally use this to make the
           directory fields contain the path from the top of the Debian
           archive hierarchy.
           Note: If you want to access the generated Sources file with
           apt(8) you will probably need to compress the file with gzip(1)
           (generating a Sources.gz file).  apt(8) ignores uncompressed
           Sources files except on local access (i.e.  file:// sources).
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --no-sort
               Do not sort the index stanzas.  Normally they are sorted by
               source package name.
           -e, --extra-override file
               Scan file to find supplementary overrides (since dpkg 1.15.4;
               the file can be compressed since dpkg 1.15.5).  See
               deb-extra-override(5) for more information on its format.
           -s, --source-override file
               Use file as the source override file (the file can be
               compressed since dpkg 1.15.5).  The default is the name of
               the override file you specified with .src appended.
               The source override file is in a different format from the
               binary override file. It contains only two whitespace
               separated fields, the first is the source package name and
               the second is the section. Blank lines and comment lines are
               ignored in the normal manner. If a package appears in both
               files the source override takes precedence for setting the
               section.
           --debug
               Turn debugging on.
           --help
               Show the usage message and exit.
           --version
               Show the version and exit.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           DPKG_COLORS
               Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
               accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.
           DPKG_NLS
               If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
               Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
               i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are:
               0 and 1 (default).
