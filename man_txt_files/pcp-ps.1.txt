## NAME         top
           pcp-ps - Report statistics for Linux Process.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] ps [-e] [-U [username]] [-V --version] [-c
           Command name] [-P pid1,pid2..]  [-p pid1,pid2..]  [-o
           col1,col2... or ALL] [-Z timezone] [-z] [-?]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The pcp-ps command is used for monitoring individual process
           running on the system.  Using various options it helps a user to
           see useful information related to the processes.  This
           information includes CPU percentage, memory and stack usage,
           scheduling and priority.  By default pcp-ps reports live data for
           the local host.
## OPTIONS         top
           When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -O/--origin,
           -t/--interval, -Z/--timezone and several other pcp options become
           indirectly available; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete
           description of these options.
           The additional command line options available for pcp-ps are:
           -e   Display all the process.
                PID    Process idenfier.
                TTY    The termianl assoicated with the prcoess.
                TIME   The  cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss
                       format (time=TIME).
                CMD    The command name of the task.
           -c [command name]
                Display the real Command name of the tasks being monitored
                instead of the UID.  If command name is specified, then only
                tasks belonging to the specified command are displayed.
           -U [username], --user-name[=username]
                Display the real user name of the tasks being monitored
                instead of the UID.  If username is specified, then only
                tasks belonging to the specified user are displayed.
           -V, --version
                Print version number then exit.
           -p pid1,pid2.., --pid-list=pid1,pid2..
                Display only processes with the listed PIDs.
           -P ppid1,ppid2.., --ppid-list=ppid1,ppid2..
                Display only processes with the listed PPIDs.
           -o   User-defined format.
                It is a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or
                comma-separated list, which offers a way to specify
                individual output columns.
                The argument to -o are following:
                COL      HEADER   DESCRIPTION

## STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS         top
           Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the
           output format (e.g. with option -o) or to sort the selected
           processes
           For example: pcp-ps -o pid,user,args
           CODE    HEADER    DESCRIPTION
           ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
           pid     PID       a number representing the process ID
           %cpu    %CPU      %cpu utilization of the process in "##.#"
                             format.
                             Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by
                             the time the process has been running
                             (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a
                             percentage.
           %mem    %MEM      %ratio of the process's resident set size  to
                             the physical memory on the machine, expressed
                             as a percentage.
           args    COMMAND   Command with all its arguments as a string.
                             Modifications to the arguments may be shown.
                             The output in this column may contain spaces.
                             A process marked <defunct> is partly dead,
                             waiting to be fully destroyed by its parent.
                             Sometimes the process args will be unavailable;
                             when this happens,will instead print the
                             executable name in brackets.
           class   CLS       scheduling class of the process.
                             Field's possible values are: -      not
                             reported

                             DLN    SCHED_DEADLINE
                             ?      unknown value
           s       S         minimal state display.  See also state if you
                             want additional information displayed.
           euid    EUID      effective user ID.
           vsz     VSZ       virtual memory size of the process in KiB
                             (1024-byte units).  Device mappings are
                             currently excluded; this is subject to change.
           euser   EUSER     effective user name.  This will be the textual
                             user ID, if it can be obtained and the field
                             width permits, or a decimal representation
                             otherwise.
           All     N/A       This option shows USER, PID, PPID, PRI, %CPU,
                             %MEM, VSZ, RSS, S, START, TIME, WCHAN and
                             COMMAND.
           -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
                  By default, pcp-ps reports the time of day according to
                  the local timezone on the system where pcp-ps is run.  The
                  -Z option changes the timezone to timezone in the format
                  of the environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).
           -z , --hostzone
                  Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
                  host that is the source of the performance metrics.  When
                  replaying a PCP archive that was captured in a foreign
                  timezone, the -z option would almost always be used (the
                  default reporting timezone is the local timezone, which
                  may not be the same as the timezone of the PCP archive).
           -? , --help
                  Display usage message and exit.
## NOTES         top
           pcp-ps is inspired by the ps(1) command and aims to be command
           line and output compatible with it.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
