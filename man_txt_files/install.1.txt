## NAME         top
           install - copy files and set attributes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           install [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
           install [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
           install [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...
           install [OPTION]... -d DIRECTORY...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This install program copies files (often just compiled) into
           destination locations you choose.  If you want to download and
           install a ready-to-use package on a GNU/Linux system, you should
           instead be using a package manager like yum(1) or apt-get(1).
           In the first three forms, copy SOURCE to DEST or multiple
           SOURCE(s) to the existing DIRECTORY, while setting permission
           modes and owner/group.  In the 4th form, create all components of
           the given DIRECTORY(ies).
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           --backup[=CONTROL]
                  make a backup of each existing destination file
           -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument
           -c     (ignored)
           -C, --compare
                  compare content of source and destination files, and if no
                  change to content, ownership, and permissions, do not
                  modify the destination at all
           -d, --directory
                  treat all arguments as directory names; create all
                  components of the specified directories
           -D     create all leading components of DEST except the last, or
                  all components of --target-directory, then copy SOURCE to
                  DEST
           --debug
                  explain how a file is copied.  Implies -v
           -g, --group=GROUP
                  set group ownership, instead of process' current group
           -m, --mode=MODE
                  set permission mode (as in chmod), instead of rwxr-xr-x
           -o, --owner=OWNER
                  set ownership (super-user only)
           -p, --preserve-timestamps
                  apply access/modification times of SOURCE files to
                  corresponding destination files
           -s, --strip
                  strip symbol tables
           --strip-program=PROGRAM
                  program used to strip binaries
           -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
                  override the usual backup suffix
           -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
                  copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY
           -T, --no-target-directory
                  treat DEST as a normal file
           -v, --verbose
                  print the name of each created file or directory
           --preserve-context
                  preserve SELinux security context
           -Z     set SELinux security context of destination file and each
                  created directory to default type
           --context[=CTX]
                  like -Z, or if CTX is specified then set the SELinux or
                  SMACK security context to CTX
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or
           SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected
           via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL
           environment variable.  Here are the values:
           none, off
                  never make backups (even if --backup is given)
           numbered, t
                  make numbered backups
           existing, nil
                  numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
           simple, never
                  always make simple backups
