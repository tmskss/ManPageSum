## NAME         top
           pmdamailq - mail queue performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq/pmdamailq [-b binlist] [-d domain] [-l
           logfile] [-r regex] [-U username] [queuedir]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdamailq is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts performance metrics describing the state of the e-mail
           queues managed by sendmail(1) and other mail transfer agents.
           The mailq PMDA exports metrics that measure the total number of
           entries in the mail queue, and the subtotals for entries that
           have been queued for various time periods.
           A brief description of the pmdamailq command line options
           follows:
           -b   The binlist argument specifies a list of delay thresholds
                used to ``bin'' the entries in the queue into a a histogram
                based on how long the entry has been in the mail queue.  The
                default thresholds are: 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 3
                days and 7 days.  The entries in binlist are comma separated
                time intervals, using the syntax described in PCPIntro(1)
                for an update or reporting interval, e.g. the default list
                could be specified using the value
                1hr,4hrs,8hrs,1day,3days,7days.
                Values in binlist are assumed to be in ascending order, and
                mail items in the queue less than the first threshold are
                binned into a special bin labeled ``recent''.
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                mailq.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdamailq is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .  If the
                log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -r   Use an extended regular expression to match file names in
                the mail queue directory, rather than assuming all "df"
                prefixed files in the directory are mail files (the "df"
                prefix is the sendmail convention, but this convention is
                not followed by other mail daemons).  The regex pattern
                specified should conform to the POSIX format described in
                regex(3), and it describes file names that should be
                considered mail.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
           The optional queuedir argument defines the directory in which
           pmdamailq expects to find the mail queue.  The default is
           /var/spool/mqueue.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           mailq performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mailq
                # ./Remove
           pmdamailq is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top

                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdamailq
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
