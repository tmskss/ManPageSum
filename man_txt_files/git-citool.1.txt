## NAME         top
           git-citool - Graphical alternative to git-commit
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git citool
## DESCRIPTION         top
           A Tcl/Tk based graphical interface to review modified files,
           stage them into the index, enter a commit message and record the
           new commit onto the current branch. This interface is an
           alternative to the less interactive git commit program.
           git citool is actually a standard alias for git gui citool. See
           git-gui(1) for more details.
