## NAME         top
           perf-daemon - Run record sessions on background
## SYNOPSIS         top
           perf daemon
           perf daemon [<options>]
           perf daemon start  [<options>]
           perf daemon stop   [<options>]
           perf daemon signal [<options>]
           perf daemon ping   [<options>]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This command allows to run simple daemon process that starts and
           monitors configured record sessions.
           You can imagine perf daemon of background process with several
           perf record child tasks, like:
               # ps axjf
               ...
                    1  916507 ... perf daemon start
               916507  916508 ...  \_ perf record --control=fifo:control,ack -m 10M -e cycles --overwrite --switch-output -a
               916507  916509 ...  \_ perf record --control=fifo:control,ack -m 20M -e sched:* --overwrite --switch-output -a
           Not every perf record session is suitable for running under
           daemon. User need perf session that either produces data on
           query, like the flight recorder sessions in above example or
           session that is configured to produce data periodically, like
           with --switch-output configuration for time and size.
           Each session is started with control setup (with perf record
           --control options).
           Sessions are configured through config file, see CONFIG FILE
           section with EXAMPLES.
## OPTIONS         top
           -v, --verbose
               Be more verbose.
           --config=<PATH>
               Config file path. If not provided, perf will check system and
               default locations (/etc/perfconfig, $HOME/.perfconfig).
           --base=<PATH>
               Base directory path. Each daemon instance is running on top
               of base directory. Only one instance of server can run on top
               of one directory at the time.
           All generic options are available also under commands.
## START COMMAND         top
           The start command creates the daemon process.
           -f, --foreground
               Do not put the process in background.
## STOP COMMAND         top
           The stop command stops all the session and the daemon process.
## SIGNAL COMMAND         top
           The signal command sends signal to configured sessions.
           --session
               Send signal to specific session.
## PING COMMAND         top
           The ping command sends control ping to configured sessions.
           --session
               Send ping to specific session.
## CONFIG FILE         top
           The daemon is configured within standard perf config file by
           following new variables:
           daemon.base: Base path for daemon data. All sessions data are
           stored under this path.
           session-<NAME>.run: Defines new record session. The value is
           record’s command line without the record keyword.
           Each perf record session is run in daemon.base/<NAME> directory.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Example with 2 record sessions:
               # cat ~/.perfconfig
               [daemon]
               base=/opt/perfdata
               [session-cycles]
               run = -m 10M -e cycles --overwrite --switch-output -a
               [session-sched]
               run = -m 20M -e sched:* --overwrite --switch-output -a
           Starting the daemon:
               # perf daemon start
           Check sessions:
               # perf daemon
               [603349:daemon] base: /opt/perfdata
               [603350:cycles] perf record -m 10M -e cycles --overwrite --switch-output -a
               [603351:sched] perf record -m 20M -e sched:* --overwrite --switch-output -a
           First line is daemon process info with configured daemon base.
           Check sessions with more info:
               # perf daemon -v
               [603349:daemon] base: /opt/perfdata
                 output:  /opt/perfdata/output
                 lock:    /opt/perfdata/lock
                 up:      1 minutes
               [603350:cycles] perf record -m 10M -e cycles --overwrite --switch-output -a
                 base:    /opt/perfdata/session-cycles
                 output:  /opt/perfdata/session-cycles/output
                 control: /opt/perfdata/session-cycles/control
                 ack:     /opt/perfdata/session-cycles/ack
                 up:      1 minutes
               [603351:sched] perf record -m 20M -e sched:* --overwrite --switch-output -a
                 base:    /opt/perfdata/session-sched
                 output:  /opt/perfdata/session-sched/output
                 control: /opt/perfdata/session-sched/control
                 ack:     /opt/perfdata/session-sched/ack
                 up:      1 minutes
           The base path is daemon/session base. The lock file is daemon’s
           lock file guarding that no other daemon is running on top of the
           base. The output file is perf record output for specific session.
           The control and ack files are perf control files. The up number
           shows minutes daemon/session is running.
           Make sure control session is online:
               # perf daemon ping
               OK   cycles
               OK   sched
           Send USR2 signal to session cycles to generate perf.data file:
               # perf daemon signal --session cycles
               signal 12 sent to session 'cycles [603452]'
               # tail -2  /opt/perfdata/session-cycles/output
               [ perf record: dump data: Woken up 1 times ]
               [ perf record: Dump perf.data.2020123017013149 ]
           Send USR2 signal to all sessions:
               # perf daemon signal
               signal 12 sent to session 'cycles [603452]'
               signal 12 sent to session 'sched [603453]'
               # tail -2  /opt/perfdata/session-cycles/output
               [ perf record: dump data: Woken up 1 times ]
               [ perf record: Dump perf.data.2020123017024689 ]
               # tail -2  /opt/perfdata/session-sched/output
               [ perf record: dump data: Woken up 1 times ]
               [ perf record: Dump perf.data.2020123017024713 ]
           Stop daemon:
               # perf daemon stop
