## NAME         top
           pmpython - run a python script using a preferred python variant
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmpython [python-args-and-script]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmpython provides a way to run python scripts using a
           customisable python interpreter, rather than embedding the name
           of a particular version of python into each script.
           This can be useful as it allows version-independent python code
           to be run anywhere.  All python modules shipped with PCP support
           versions 2.6 and later (in the python2 series), and 3.3 and later
           (in the python3 release series).
           Due to python monitoring and collecting scripts being relatively
           simple in PCP (not requiring new modules, language features,
           etc), it has been possible to ensure they work for all of the
           above python versions.
           However, the name of the python interpreter is not always the
           same, thus, it is common for PCP python scripts to use a
           “shebang” line that launches the python interpreter indirectly as
           follows:
              #!/usr/bin/env pmpython
           env(1) is used to find the correct path for the pmpython
           executable from the user's $PATH.
           By default the name of the python interpreter is found from the
           the value of $PCP_PYTHON_PROG from the environment (if set) else
           from /etc/pcp.conf.  The latter is the more typical case where
           this value is based on some heuristics about the platform at the
           time the PCP packages were build and favour the use of python3 in
           all recent releases of PCP (for those platforms that support it).
           This allows an appropriate name to be used for the python
           interpreter instead of a hard-coded python version name, while
           still allowing the user to override the python interpreter as
           follows:
              $ PCP_PYTHON_PROG=python3 pmpython --version
              Python 3.4.2
              $ PCP_PYTHON_PROG=python2 pmpython --version
              Python 2.7.9
           This is convenient for shipping identical scripts on multiple
           platforms, and for testing different python versions with the one
           script (e.g. in the case where multiple versions of python are
           installed, PCP_PYTHON_PROG can be set in the local environment to
           override the global setting).
           pmpython is a replacement for an earlier tool with similar
           function, namely pcp-python(1).
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
