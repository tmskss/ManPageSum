## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-listen - listen for incoming connection to record
           tracing.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd listen -p port [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) listen sets up a port to listen to waiting for
           connections from other hosts that run trace-cmd-record(1) with
           the -N option. When a connection is made, and the remote host
           sends data, it will create a file called trace.HOST:PORT.dat.
           Where HOST is the name of the remote host, and PORT is the port
           that the remote host used to connect with.
## OPTIONS         top
           -p port
               This option will specify the port to listen to.
           -D
               This options causes trace-cmd listen to go into a daemon mode
               and run in the background.
           -V
               Listen on a vsocket instead. This is useful for tracing
               between host and guest VMs.
           -d dir
               This option specifies a directory to write the data files
               into.
           -o filename
               This option overrides the default trace in the
               trace.HOST:PORT.dat that is created when a remote host
               connects.
           -l filename
               This option writes the output messages to a log file instead
               of standard output.
           --verbose[=level]
               Set the log level. Supported log levels are "none",
               "critical", "error", "warning", "info", "debug", "all" or
               their identifiers "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6". Setting
               the log level to specific value enables all logs from that
               and all previous levels. The level will default to "info" if
               one is not specified.
                   Example: enable all critical, error and warning logs
                   trace-cmd listen --verbose=warning
