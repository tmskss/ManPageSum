## NAME         top
           stg-rebase - Move the stack base to another point in history
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg rebase [OPTIONS] [committish]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Pop all patches from the current stack, move the stack base to
           the given new base and push the patches back.
           Merge conflicts may arise when patches are being pushed-back onto
           the stack. If this occurs, resolve the conflicts and then
           continue the rebase with the following sequence:
               stg add --update
               stg refresh
               stg goto top-patch
           Or to skip the conflicting patch:
               stg undo --hard
               stg push next-patch..top-patch
## OPTIONS         top
           -i, --interactive
               Interactively manipulate patches in editor
           -n, --nopush
               Do not push back patches after rebasing
           -m, --merged
               Check for patches that may have been merged upstream.
               When pushing-back patches, each patch is checked to see if
               its changes already exist in the new stack base. If a patch’s
               changes are detected to have been merged, the patch will
               still exist in the stack, but become empty after the rebase
               operation.
           --committer-date-is-author-date
               Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
               the author date of the commit as the committer date.
           --autostash
               Automatically create a temporary stash before the operation
               begins, and apply it after the operation completes. This
               allows a rebase to be performed on a dirty work tree. Note
               however that the final stash application may result in
               non-trivial conflicts.
           --conflicts[=<policy>]
               Either "allow" or "disallow" pushing a patch with conflicts.
               Using --conflicts=allow (or just --conflicts) allows pushing
               a patch that may result in unresolved merge conflicts. The
               patch will be pushed and files with conflicts will be left
               with conflict markers to be resolved manually; or the
               operation undone with stg undo --hard. This is the default
               behavior and also corresponds to the
               "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" variable being set to "true".
               Using --conflicts=disallow disallows pushing any patch that
               would result in merge conflicts. The operation will stop on
               the last patch that can be pushed without conflicts. This
               behavior can be configured by setting
               "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" to "false".
