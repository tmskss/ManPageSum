    DIFF(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               DIFF(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           diff — compare two files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           diff [-c|-e|-f|-u|-C n|-U n] [-br] file1 file2
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The diff utility shall compare the contents of file1 and file2
           and write to standard output a list of changes necessary to
           convert file1 into file2.  This list should be minimal. No output
           shall be produced if the files are identical.
## OPTIONS         top
           The diff utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -b        Cause any amount of white space at the end of a line to
                     be treated as a single <newline> (that is, the white-
                     space characters preceding the <newline> are ignored)
                     and other strings of white-space characters, not
                     including <newline> characters, to compare equal.
           -c        Produce output in a form that provides three lines of
                     copied context.
           -C n      Produce output in a form that provides n lines of
                     copied context (where n shall be interpreted as a
                     positive decimal integer).
           -e        Produce output in a form suitable as input for the ed
                     utility, which can then be used to convert file1 into
                     file2.
           -f        Produce output in an alternative form, similar in
                     format to -e, but not intended to be suitable as input
                     for the ed utility, and in the opposite order.
           -r        Apply diff recursively to files and directories of the
                     same name when file1 and file2 are both directories.
                     The diff utility shall detect infinite loops; that is,
                     entering a previously visited directory that is an
                     ancestor of the last file encountered.  When it detects
                     an infinite loop, diff shall write a diagnostic message
                     to standard error and shall either recover its position
                     in the hierarchy or terminate.
           -u        Produce output in a form that provides three lines of
                     unified context.
           -U n      Produce output in a form that provides n lines of
                     unified context (where n shall be interpreted as a non-
                     negative decimal integer).
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           file1, file2
                     A pathname of a file to be compared. If either the
                     file1 or file2 operand is '-', the standard input shall
                     be used in its place.
           If both file1 and file2 are directories, diff shall not compare
           block special files, character special files, or FIFO special
           files to any files and shall not compare regular files to
           directories.  Further details are as specified in Diff Directory
           Comparison Format.  The behavior of diff on other file types is
           implementation-defined when found in directories.
           If only one of file1 and file2 is a directory, diff shall be
           applied to the non-directory file and the file contained in the
           directory file with a filename that is the same as the last
           component of the non-directory file.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be used only if one of the file1 or
           file2 operands references standard input. See the INPUT FILES
           section.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The input files may be of any type.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           diff:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error and informative messages written to
                     standard output.
           LC_TIME   Determine the locale for affecting the format of file
                     timestamps written with the -C and -c options.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
           TZ        Determine the timezone used for calculating file
                     timestamps written with a context format. If TZ is
                     unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be
                     used.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
       Diff Directory Comparison Format
           If both file1 and file2 are directories, the following output
           formats shall be used.
           In the POSIX locale, each file that is present in only one
           directory shall be reported using the following format:
               "Only in %s: %s\n", <directory pathname>, <filename>
           In the POSIX locale, subdirectories that are common to the two
           directories may be reported with the following format:
               "Common subdirectories: %s and %s\n", <directory1 pathname>,
                   <directory2 pathname>
           For each file common to the two directories, if the two files are
           not to be compared: if the two files have the same device ID and
           file serial number, or are both block special files that refer to
           the same device, or are both character special files that refer
           to the same device, in the POSIX locale the output format is
           unspecified.  Otherwise, in the POSIX locale an unspecified
           format shall be used that contains the pathnames of the two
           files.
           For each file common to the two directories, if the files are
           compared and are identical, no output shall be written. If the
           two files differ, the following format is written:
               "diff %s %s %s\n", <diff_options>, <filename1>, <filename2>
           where <diff_options> are the options as specified on the command
           line.
           All directory pathnames listed in this section shall be relative
           to the original command line arguments. All other names of files
           listed in this section shall be filenames (pathname components).
       Diff Binary Output Format
           In the POSIX locale, if one or both of the files being compared
           are not text files, it is implementation-defined whether diff
           uses the binary file output format or the other formats as
           specified below. The binary file output format shall contain the
           pathnames of two files being compared and the string "differ".
           If both files being compared are text files, depending on the
           options specified, one of the following formats shall be used to
           write the differences.
       Diff Default Output Format
           The default (without -e, -f, -c, -C, -u, or -U options) diff
           utility output shall contain lines of these forms:
               "%da%d\n", <num1>, <num2>
               "%da%d,%d\n", <num1>, <num2>, <num3>
               "%dd%d\n", <num1>, <num2>
               "%d,%dd%d\n", <num1>, <num2>, <num3>
               "%dc%d\n", <num1>, <num2>
               "%d,%dc%d\n", <num1>, <num2>, <num3>
               "%dc%d,%d\n", <num1>, <num2>, <num3>
               "%d,%dc%d,%d\n", <num1>, <num2>, <num3>, <num4>
           These lines resemble ed subcommands to convert file1 into file2.
           The line numbers before the action letters shall pertain to
           file1; those after shall pertain to file2.  Thus, by exchanging a
           for d and reading the line in reverse order, one can also
           determine how to convert file2 into file1.  As in ed, identical
           pairs (where num1= num2) are abbreviated as a single number.
           Following each of these lines, diff shall write to standard
           output all lines affected in the first file using the format:
               "< %s", <line>
           and all lines affected in the second file using the format:
               "> %s", <line>
           If there are lines affected in both file1 and file2 (as with the
           c subcommand), the changes are separated with a line consisting
           of three <hyphen-minus> characters:
               "---\n"
       Diff -e Output Format
           With the -e option, a script shall be produced that shall, when
           provided as input to ed, along with an appended w (write)
           command, convert file1 into file2.  Only the a (append), c
           (change), d (delete), i (insert), and s (substitute) commands of
           ed shall be used in this script. Text lines, except those
           consisting of the single character <period> ('.'), shall be
           output as they appear in the file.
       Diff -f Output Format
           With the -f option, an alternative format of script shall be
           produced. It is similar to that produced by -e, with the
           following differences:
            1. It is expressed in reverse sequence; the output of -e orders
               changes from the end of the file to the beginning; the -f
               from beginning to end.
            2. The command form <lines> <command-letter> used by -e is
               reversed. For example, 10c with -e would be c10 with -f.
            3. The form used for ranges of line numbers is
               <space>-separated, rather than <comma>-separated.
       Diff -c or -C Output Format
           With the -c or -C option, the output format shall consist of
           affected lines along with surrounding lines of context. The
           affected lines shall show which ones need to be deleted or
           changed in file1, and those added from file2.  With the -c
           option, three lines of context, if available, shall be written
           before and after the affected lines. With the -C option, the user
           can specify how many lines of context are written.  The exact
           format follows.
           The name and last modification time of each file shall be output
           in the following format:
               "*** %s %s\n", file1, <file1 timestamp>
               "--- %s %s\n", file2, <file2 timestamp>
           Each <file> field shall be the pathname of the corresponding file
           being compared. The pathname written for standard input is
           unspecified.
           In the POSIX locale, each <timestamp> field shall be equivalent
           to the output from the following command:
               date "+%a %b %e %T %Y"
           without the trailing <newline>, executed at the time of last
           modification of the corresponding file (or the current time, if
           the file is standard input).
           Then, the following output formats shall be applied for every set
           of changes.
           First, a line shall be written in the following format:
               "***************\n"
           Next, the range of lines in file1 shall be written in the
           following format if the range contains two or more lines:
               "*** %d,%d ****\n", <beginning line number>, <ending line number>
           and the following format otherwise:
               "*** %d ****\n", <ending line number>
           The ending line number of an empty range shall be the number of
           the preceding line, or 0 if the range is at the start of the
           file.
           Next, the affected lines along with lines of context (unaffected
           lines) shall be written. Unaffected lines shall be written in the
           following format:
               "  %s", <unaffected_line>
           Deleted lines shall be written as:
               "- %s", <deleted_line>
           Changed lines shall be written as:
               "! %s", <changed_line>
           Next, the range of lines in file2 shall be written in the
           following format if the range contains two or more lines:
               "--- %d,%d ----\n", <beginning line number>, <ending line number>
           and the following format otherwise:
               "--- %d ----\n", <ending line number>
           Then, lines of context and changed lines shall be written as
           described in the previous formats. Lines added from file2 shall
           be written in the following format:
               "+ %s", <added_line>
       Diff -u or -U Output Format
           The -u or -U options behave like the -c or -C options, except
           that the context lines are not repeated; instead, the context,
           deleted, and added lines are shown together, interleaved.  The
           exact format follows.
           The name and last modification time of each file shall be output
           in the following format:
               "--- %s\t%s%s %s\n", file1, <file1 timestamp>, <file1 frac>, <file1 zone>
               "+++ %s\t%s%s %s\n", file2, <file2 timestamp>, <file2 frac>, <file2 zone>
           Each <file> field shall be the pathname of the corresponding file
           being compared, or the single character '-' if standard input is
           being compared. However, if the pathname contains a <tab> or a
           <newline>, or if it does not consist entirely of characters taken
           from the portable character set, the behavior is implementation-
           defined.
           Each <timestamp> field shall be equivalent to the output from the
           following command:
               date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
           without the trailing <newline>, executed at the time of last
           modification of the corresponding file (or the current time, if
           the file is standard input).
           Each <frac> field shall be either empty, or a decimal point
           followed by at least one decimal digit, indicating the
           fractional-seconds part (if any) of the file timestamp. The
           number of fractional digits shall be at least the number needed
           to represent the file's timestamp without loss of information.
           Each <zone> field shall be of the form "shhmm", where "shh" is a
           signed two-digit decimal number in the range -24 through +25, and
           "mm" is an unsigned two-digit decimal number in the range 00
           through 59.  It represents the timezone of the timestamp as the
           number of hours (hh) and minutes (mm) east (+) or west (-) of UTC
           for the timestamp.  If the hours and minutes are both zero, the
           sign shall be '+'.  However, if the timezone is not an integral
           number of minutes away from UTC, the <zone> field is
           implementation-defined.
           Then, the following output formats shall be applied for every set
           of changes.
           First, the range of lines in each file shall be written in the
           following format:
               "@@ -%s +%s @@", <file1 range>, <file2 range>
           Each <range> field shall be of the form:
               "%1d", <beginning line number>
           or:
               "%1d,1", <beginning line number>
           if the range contains exactly one line, and:
               "%1d,%1d", <beginning line number>, <number of lines>
           otherwise. If a range is empty, its beginning line number shall
           be the number of the line just before the range, or 0 if the
           empty range starts the file.
           Next, the affected lines along with lines of context shall be
           written.  Each non-empty unaffected line shall be written in the
           following format:
               " %s", <unaffected_line>
           where the contents of the unaffected line shall be taken from
           file1.  It is implementation-defined whether an empty unaffected
           line is written as an empty line or a line containing a single
           <space> character. This line also represents the same line of
           file2, even though file2's line may contain different contents
           due to the -b.  Deleted lines shall be written as:
               "-%s", <deleted_line>
           Added lines shall be written as:
               "+%s", <added_line>
           The order of lines written shall be the same as that of the
           corresponding file. A deleted line shall never be written
           immediately after an added line.
           If -U n is specified, the output shall contain no more than 2n
           consecutive unaffected lines; and if the output contains an
           affected line and this line is adjacent to up to n consecutive
           unaffected lines in the corresponding file, the output shall
           contain these unaffected lines.  -u shall act like -U3.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    No differences were found.
            1    Differences were found.
           >1    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           If lines at the end of a file are changed and other lines are
           added, diff output may show this as a delete and add, as a
           change, or as a change and add; diff is not expected to know
           which happened and users should not care about the difference in
           output as long as it clearly shows the differences between the
           files.
## EXAMPLES         top
           If dir1 is a directory containing a directory named x, dir2 is a
           directory containing a directory named x, dir1/x and dir2/x both
           contain files named date.out, and dir2/x contains a file named y,
           the command:
               diff -r dir1 dir2
           could produce output similar to:
               Common subdirectories: dir1/x and dir2/x
               Only in dir2/x: y
               diff -r dir1/x/date.out dir2/x/date.out

## RATIONALE         top
           The -h option was omitted because it was insufficiently specified
           and does not add to applications portability.
           Historical implementations employ algorithms that do not always
           produce a minimum list of differences; the current language about
           making every effort is the best this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 can
           do, as there is no metric that could be employed to judge the
           quality of implementations against any and all file contents. The
           statement ``This list should be minimal'' clearly implies that
           implementations are not expected to provide the following output
           when comparing two 100-line files that differ in only one
           character on a single line:
               1,100c1,100
               all 100 lines from file1 preceded with "< "
               ---
               all 100 lines from file2 preceded with "> "
           The ``Only in'' messages required when the -r option is specified
           are not used by most historical implementations if the -e option
           is also specified. It is required here because it provides useful
           information that must be provided to update a target directory
           hierarchy to match a source hierarchy. The ``Common
           subdirectories'' messages are written by System V and 4.3 BSD
           when the -r option is specified. They are allowed here but are
           not required because they are reporting on something that is the
           same, not reporting a difference, and are not needed to update a
           target hierarchy.
           The -c option, which writes output in a format using lines of
           context, has been included. The format is useful for a variety of
           reasons, among them being much improved readability and the
           ability to understand difference changes when the target file has
           line numbers that differ from another similar, but slightly
           different, copy. The patch utility is most valuable when working
           with difference listings using a context format. The BSD version
           of -c takes an optional argument specifying the amount of
           context. Rather than overloading -c and breaking the Utility
           Syntax Guidelines for diff, the standard developers decided to
           add a separate option for specifying a context diff with a
           specified amount of context (-C).  Also, the format for context
           diffs was extended slightly in 4.3 BSD to allow multiple changes
           that are within context lines from each other to be merged
           together. The output format contains an additional four
           <asterisk> characters after the range of affected lines in the
           first filename. This was to provide a flag for old programs (like
           old versions of patch) that only understand the old context
           format. The version of context described here does not require
           that multiple changes within context lines be merged, but it does
           not prohibit it either. The extension is upwards-compatible, so
           any vendors that wish to retain the old version of diff can do so
           by adding the extra four <asterisk> characters (that is,
           utilities that currently use diff and understand the new merged
           format will also understand the old unmerged format, but not vice
           versa).
           The -u and -U options of GNU diff have been included. Their
           output format, designed by Wayne Davison, takes up less space
           than -c and -C format, and in many cases is easier to read. The
           format's timestamps do not vary by locale, so LC_TIME does not
           affect it. The format's line numbers are rendered with the %1d
           format, not %d, because the file format notation rules would
           allow extra <blank> characters to appear around the numbers.
           The substitute command was added as an additional format for the
           -e option. This was added to provide implementations with a way
           to fix the classic ``dot alone on a line'' bug present in many
           versions of diff.  Since many implementations have fixed this
           bug, the standard developers decided not to standardize broken
           behavior, but rather to provide the necessary tool for fixing the
           bug. One way to fix this bug is to output two periods whenever a
           lone period is needed, then terminate the append command with a
           period, and then use the substitute command to convert the two
           periods into one period.
           The BSD-derived -r option was added to provide a mechanism for
           using diff to compare two file system trees. This behavior is
           useful, is standard practice on all BSD-derived systems, and is
           not easily reproducible with the find utility.
           The requirement that diff not compare files in some
           circumstances, even though they have the same name, is based on
           the actual output of historical implementations.  The specified
           behavior precludes the problems arising from running into FIFOs
           and other files that would cause diff to hang waiting for input
           with no indication to the user that diff was hung. An earlier
           version of this standard specified the output format more
           precisely, but in practice this requirement was widely ignored
           and the benefit of standardization seemed small, so it is now
           unspecified. In most common usage, diff -r should indicate
           differences in the file hierarchies, not the difference of
           contents of devices pointed to by the hierarchies.
           Many early implementations of diff require seekable files. Since
           the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 supports named
           pipes, the standard developers decided that such a restriction
           was unreasonable.  Note also that the allowed filename - almost
           always refers to a pipe.
           No directory search order is specified for diff.  The historical
           ordering is, in fact, not optimal, in that it prints out all of
           the differences at the current level, including the statements
           about all common subdirectories before recursing into those
           subdirectories.
           The message:
               "diff %s %s %s\n", <diff_options>, <filename1>, <filename2>
           does not vary by locale because it is the representation of a
           command, not an English sentence.
