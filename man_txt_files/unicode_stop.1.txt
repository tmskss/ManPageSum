    UNICODE_STOP(1)          General Commands Manual         UNICODE_STOP(1)
## NAME         top
           unicode_stop - revert keyboard and console from unicode mode
## SYNOPSIS         top
           unicode_stop
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The unicode_stop command will more-or-less undo the effect of
           unicode_start.  It puts the keyboard in ASCII (XLATE) mode, and
           clears the console UTF-8 mode.
