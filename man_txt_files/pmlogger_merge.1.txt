## NAME         top
           pmlogger_merge - helper script to merge Performance Co-Pilot
           archives
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_merge [-fNVE?]  [input-basename ...
           output-name]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmlogger_merge is a helper script that is used by
           pmlogger_daily(1) when merging all of the Performance Co-Pilot
           (PCP) archives for a single host on a single day into a combined
           PCP archive.
           pmlogger_merge is a wrapper script for pmlogextract(1) that
           merges all of the archive logs matching the input-basename
           arguments, and creates a new archive using output-name as the
           base name for the physical files that constitute an archive log.
           The input-basename arguments may contain meta characters in the
           style of sh(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -f, --force
                This option causes all of the input files to be removed once
                the output archive has been created.
           -N, --showme
                Runs pmlogger_merge in a ``show me'' or ``dry run'' mode
                where the tasks that would be performed are reported, but no
                changes are made.  This is typically used for debugging in
                combination with one (verbose) or two (very verbose) -V
                options.
           -V, --verbose
                Increase verbosity in the output progress report.
           -E, --expunge
                When metric metadata differences are encountered between
                archives to be merged, the default behaviour is for
                pmlogger_merge to fail with a fatal error and the output-
                name archive is not created.  The -E flag instead issues a
                warning and excludes the affected metrics from the merged
                output archive.  This is intended for automated daily log
                rotation where it is highly desirable for unattended daily
                archive merging, rewriting and compression to succeed.  See
                also pmlogger_daily(1) and the -x flag to pmlogextract(1).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
