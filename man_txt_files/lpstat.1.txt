## NAME         top
           lpstat - print cups status information
## SYNOPSIS         top
           lpstat [ -E ] [ -H ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -l
           ] [ -W which-jobs ] [ -a [ destination(s) ] ] [ -c [ class(es) ]
           ] [ -d ] [ -e ] [ -o [ destination(s) ] ] [ -p [ printer(s) ] ] [
           -r ] [ -R ] [ -s ] [ -t ] [ -u [ user(s) ] ] [ -v [ printer(s) ]
           ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           lpstat displays status information about the current classes,
           jobs, and printers.  When run with no arguments, lpstat will list
           active jobs queued by the current user.
## OPTIONS         top
           The lpstat command supports the following options:
           -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.
           -H   Shows the server hostname and port.
           -R   Shows the ranking of print jobs.
           -U username
                Specifies an alternate username.
           -W which-jobs
                Specifies which jobs to show, "completed" or "not-completed"
                (the default).  This option must appear before the -o option
                and/or any printer names, otherwise the default ("not-
                completed") value will be used in the request to the
                scheduler.
           -a [printer(s)]
                Shows the accepting state of printer queues.  If no printers
                are specified then all printers are listed.
           -c [class(es)]
                Shows the printer classes and the printers that belong to
                them.  If no classes are specified then all classes are
                listed.
           -d   Shows the current default destination.
           -e   Shows all available destinations on the local network.
           -h server[:port]
                Specifies an alternate server.
           -l   Shows a long listing of printers, classes, or jobs.
           -o [destination(s)]
                Shows the jobs queued on the specified destinations.  If no
                destinations are specified all jobs are shown.
           -p [printer(s)]
                Shows the printers and whether they are enabled for
                printing.  If no printers are specified then all printers
                are listed.
           -r   Shows whether the CUPS server is running.
           -s   Shows a status summary, including the default destination, a
                list of classes and their member printers, and a list of
                printers and their associated devices.  This is equivalent
                to using the -d, -c, and -v options.
           -t   Shows all status information.  This is equivalent to using
                the -r, -d, -c, -v, -a, -p, and -o options.
           -u [user(s)]
                Shows a list of print jobs queued by the specified users.
                If no users are specified, lists the jobs queued by the
                current user.
           -v [printer(s)]
                Shows the printers and what device they are attached to.  If
                no printers are specified then all printers are listed.
## CONFORMING TO         top
           Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to
           contain any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", and "#".
           Also, printer and class names are not case-sensitive.
           The -h, -e, -E, -U, and -W options are unique to CUPS.
           The Solaris -f, -P, and -S options are silently ignored.
