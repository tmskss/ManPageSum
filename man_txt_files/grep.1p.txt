           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the

## NAME         top
           grep — search a file for a pattern
## SYNOPSIS         top
           grep [-E|-F] [-c|-l|-q] [-insvx] -e pattern_list
               [-e pattern_list]... [-f pattern_file]... [file...]
           grep [-E|-F] [-c|-l|-q] [-insvx] [-e pattern_list]...
               -f pattern_file [-f pattern_file]... [file...]
           grep [-E|-F] [-c|-l|-q] [-insvx] pattern_list [file...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The grep utility shall search the input files, selecting lines
           matching one or more patterns; the types of patterns are
           controlled by the options specified. The patterns are specified
           by the -e option, -f option, or the pattern_list operand. The
           pattern_list's value shall consist of one or more patterns
           separated by <newline> characters; the pattern_file's contents
           shall consist of one or more patterns terminated by a <newline>
           character. By default, an input line shall be selected if any
           pattern, treated as an entire basic regular expression (BRE) as
           described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section
           9.3, Basic Regular Expressions, matches any part of the line
           excluding the terminating <newline>; a null BRE shall match every
           line. By default, each selected input line shall be written to
           the standard output.
           Regular expression matching shall be based on text lines. Since a
           <newline> separates or terminates patterns (see the -e and -f
           options below), regular expressions cannot contain a <newline>.
           Similarly, since patterns are matched against individual lines
           (excluding the terminating <newline> characters) of the input,
           there is no way for a pattern to match a <newline> found in the
           input.
## OPTIONS         top
           The grep utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -E        Match using extended regular expressions.  Treat each
                     pattern specified as an ERE, as described in the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 9.4,
                     Extended Regular Expressions.  If any entire ERE
                     pattern matches some part of an input line excluding
                     the terminating <newline>, the line shall be matched. A
                     null ERE shall match every line.
           -F        Match using fixed strings. Treat each pattern specified
                     as a string instead of a regular expression. If an
                     input line contains any of the patterns as a contiguous
                     sequence of bytes, the line shall be matched.  A null
                     string shall match every line.
           -c        Write only a count of selected lines to standard
                     output.
           -e pattern_list
                     Specify one or more patterns to be used during the
                     search for input.  The application shall ensure that
                     patterns in pattern_list are separated by a <newline>.
                     A null pattern can be specified by two adjacent
                     <newline> characters in pattern_list.  Unless the -E or
                     -F option is also specified, each pattern shall be
                     treated as a BRE, as described in the Base Definitions
                     volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 9.3, Basic Regular
                     Expressions.  Multiple -e and -f options shall be
                     accepted by the grep utility. All of the specified
                     patterns shall be used when matching lines, but the
                     order of evaluation is unspecified.
           -f pattern_file
                     Read one or more patterns from the file named by the
                     pathname pattern_file.  Patterns in pattern_file shall
                     be terminated by a <newline>.  A null pattern can be
                     specified by an empty line in pattern_file.  Unless the
                     -E or -F option is also specified, each pattern shall
                     be treated as a BRE, as described in the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 9.3, Basic
                     Regular Expressions.
           -i        Perform pattern matching in searches without regard to
                     case; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                     Section 9.2, Regular Expression General Requirements.
           -l        (The letter ell.) Write only the names of files
                     containing selected lines to standard output. Pathnames
                     shall be written once per file searched. If the
                     standard input is searched, a pathname of
                     "(standardinput)" shall be written, in the POSIX
                     locale. In other locales, "standardinput" may be
                     replaced by something more appropriate in those
                     locales.
           -n        Precede each output line by its relative line number in
                     the file, each file starting at line 1. The line number
                     counter shall be reset for each file processed.
           -q        Quiet. Nothing shall be written to the standard output,
                     regardless of matching lines. Exit with zero status if
                     an input line is selected.
           -s        Suppress the error messages ordinarily written for
                     nonexistent or unreadable files. Other error messages
                     shall not be suppressed.
           -v        Select lines not matching any of the specified
                     patterns. If the -v option is not specified, selected
                     lines shall be those that match any of the specified
                     patterns.
           -x        Consider only input lines that use all characters in
                     the line excluding the terminating <newline> to match
                     an entire fixed string or regular expression to be
                     matching lines.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           pattern_list
                     Specify one or more patterns to be used during the
                     search for input.  This operand shall be treated as if
                     it were specified as -e pattern_list.
           file      A pathname of a file to be searched for the patterns.
                     If no file operands are specified, the standard input
                     shall be used.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be used if no file operands are
           specified, and shall be used if a file operand is '-' and the
           implementation treats the '-' as meaning standard input.
           Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT
           FILES section.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The input files shall be text files.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           grep:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_COLLATE
                     Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                     equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                     elements within regular expressions.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files) and the
                     behavior of character classes within regular
                     expressions.
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           If the -l option is in effect, the following shall be written for
           each file containing at least one selected input line:
               "%s\n", <file>
           Otherwise, if more than one file argument appears, and -q is not
           specified, the grep utility shall prefix each output line by:
               "%s:", <file>
           The remainder of each output line shall depend on the other
           options specified:
            *  If the -c option is in effect, the remainder of each output
               line shall contain:
                   "%d\n", <count>
            *  Otherwise, if -c is not in effect and the -n option is in
               effect, the following shall be written to standard output:
                   "%d:", <line number>
            *  Finally, the following shall be written to standard output:
                   "%s", <selected-line contents>
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    One or more lines were selected.
            1    No lines were selected.
           >1    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           If the -q option is specified, the exit status shall be zero if
           an input line is selected, even if an error was detected.
           Otherwise, default actions shall be performed.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           Care should be taken when using characters in pattern_list that
           may also be meaningful to the command interpreter. It is safest
           to enclose the entire pattern_list argument in single-quotes:
               '...'
           The -e pattern_list option has the same effect as the
           pattern_list operand, but is useful when pattern_list begins with
           the <hyphen-minus> delimiter. It is also useful when it is more
           convenient to provide multiple patterns as separate arguments.
           Multiple -e and -f options are accepted and grep uses all of the
           patterns it is given while matching input text lines.  (Note that
           the order of evaluation is not specified. If an implementation
           finds a null string as a pattern, it is allowed to use that
           pattern first, matching every line, and effectively ignore any
           other patterns.)
           The -q option provides a means of easily determining whether or
           not a pattern (or string) exists in a group of files. When
           searching several files, it provides a performance improvement
           (because it can quit as soon as it finds the first match) and
           requires less care by the user in choosing the set of files to
           supply as arguments (because it exits zero if it finds a match
           even if grep detected an access or read error on earlier file
           operands).
           When using grep to process pathnames, it is recommended that
           LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or
           C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences
           that do not form valid characters in some locales, in which case
           the utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX locale
           each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this
           problem is avoided.
## EXAMPLES         top
            1. To find all uses of the word "Posix" (in any case) in file
               text.mm and write with line numbers:
                   grep -i -n posix text.mm
            2. To find all empty lines in the standard input:
                   grep ^$
               or:
                   grep -v .
            3. Both of the following commands print all lines containing
               strings "abc" or "def" or both:
                   grep -E 'abc|def'
                   grep -F 'abc
                   def'
            4. Both of the following commands print all lines matching
               exactly "abc" or "def":
                   grep -E '^abc$|^def$'
                   grep -F -x 'abc
                   def'
## RATIONALE         top
           This grep has been enhanced in an upwards-compatible way to
           provide the exact functionality of the historical egrep and fgrep
           commands as well. It was the clear intention of the standard
           developers to consolidate the three greps into a single command.
           The old egrep and fgrep commands are likely to be supported for
           many years to come as implementation extensions, allowing
           historical applications to operate unmodified.
           Historical implementations usually silently ignored all but one
           of multiply-specified -e and -f options, but were not consistent
           as to which specification was actually used.
           The -b option was omitted from the OPTIONS section because block
           numbers are implementation-defined.
           The System V restriction on using - to mean standard input was
           omitted.
           A definition of action taken when given a null BRE or ERE is
           specified.  This is an error condition in some historical
           implementations.
           The -l option previously indicated that its use was undefined
           when no files were explicitly named. This behavior was historical
           and placed an unnecessary restriction on future implementations.
           It has been removed.
           The historical BSD grep -s option practice is easily duplicated
           by redirecting standard output to /dev/null.  The -s option
           required here is from System V.
           The -x option, historically available only with fgrep, is
           available here for all of the non-obsolescent versions.
