## NAME         top
           gendiff - utility to aid in error-free diff file generation
## SYNOPSIS         top
           gendiff <directory> <diff-extension>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           gendiff is a rather simple script which aids in generating a diff
           file from a single directory.  It takes a directory name and a
           "diff-extension" as its only arguments.  The diff extension
           should be a unique sequence of characters added to the end of all
           original, unmodified files.  The output of the program is a diff
           file which may be applied with the patch program to recreate the
           changes.
           The usual sequence of events for creating a diff is to create two
           identical directories, make changes in one directory, and then
           use the diff utility to create a list of differences between the
           two.  Using gendiff eliminates the need for the extra, original
           and unmodified directory copy.  Instead, only the individual
           files that are modified need to be saved.
           Before editing a file, copy the file, appending the extension you
           have chosen to the filename.  I.e.  if you were going to edit
           somefile.cpp and have chosen the extension "fix", copy it to
           somefile.cpp.fix before editing it.  Then edit the first copy
           (somefile.cpp).
           After editing all the files you need to edit in this fashion,
           enter the directory one level above where your source code
           resides, and then type
                      $ gendiff somedirectory .fix > mydiff-fix.patch
           You should redirect the output to a file (as illustrated) unless
           you want to see the results on stdout.
