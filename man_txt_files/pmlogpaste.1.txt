## NAME         top
           pmlogpaste - paste text into a metric in a PCP archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmlogpaste [-?]  [-f file] [-h hostname] [-l label] [-m metric]
           [-o outfile] [-t timezone]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmlogpaste takes input text from a file or the command line, and
           writes it as a metric value in a new PCP archive.  This metric
           value is timestamped with the current time, and is stored as a
           string type metric.
           The main purpose of this tool is to take captured output and
           preserve this in a PCP archive.  This allows, for example, the
           output of a benchmark run to be stored along with performance
           metrics captured during that run, in a single archive.  Archives
           can be merged using the pmlogextract(1) utility.
           pmlogpaste uses the LOGIMPORT(3) library interfaces internally,
           which support the creation of archives from external sources of
           performance data.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -f file, --file=file
                File with input text to be archived, or ``-'' for standard
                input.
           -h hostname, --hostname=hostname
                Source host name for the archive.  The default value is the
                local host name, or ``localhost'' if that cannot be
                obtained.
           -l label, --label=label
                Add context labels to the generated archive.  This option
                can be presented multiple times to produce multiple labels
                in the archive.  The label should be in the form name:value.
           -m metric, --metric=metric
                Metric name for the archive.  The default metric name is
                paste.value.
           -o outfile, --outfile=outfile
                Archive output file.  The default archive name is paste.
           -t timezone, --timezone=timezone
                Source timezone for the archive archive.  The default value
                is the local timezone.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
