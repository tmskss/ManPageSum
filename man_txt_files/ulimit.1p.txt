    ULIMIT(1P)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             ULIMIT(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           ulimit — set or report file size limit
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ulimit [-f] [blocks]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The ulimit utility shall set or report the file-size writing
           limit imposed on files written by the shell and its child
           processes (files of any size may be read). Only a process with
           appropriate privileges can increase the limit.
## OPTIONS         top
           The ulimit utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following option shall be supported:
           -f        Set (or report, if no blocks operand is present), the
                     file size limit in blocks. The -f option shall also be
                     the default case.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           blocks    The number of 512-byte blocks to use as the new file
                     size limit.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           ulimit:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The standard output shall be used when no blocks operand is
           present. If the current number of blocks is limited, the number
           of blocks in the current limit shall be written in the following
           format:
               "%d\n", <number of 512-byte blocks>
           If there is no current limit on the number of blocks, in the
           POSIX locale the following format shall be used:
               "unlimited\n"
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    A request for a higher limit was rejected or an error
                 occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           Since ulimit affects the current shell execution environment, it
           is always provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called
           in a separate utility execution environment, such as one of the
           following:
               nohup ulimit -f 10000
               env ulimit 10000
           it does not affect the file size limit of the caller's
           environment.
           Once a limit has been decreased by a process, it cannot be
           increased (unless appropriate privileges are involved), even back
           to the original system limit.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Set the file size limit to 51200 bytes:
               ulimit -f 100
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
