## NAME         top
           pmiestatus - display information from pmie stats file
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmiestatus statsfile [...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmiestatus displays information used to identify a running
           pmie(1) process.  It is mostly used by pmie_check(1) and
           pmie_daily(1) when they hunt for instances of pmie to check
           against the control file.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_TMP_DIR/pmie/*
                pmie stats files
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
           pmie(1), pmie_check(1), pmie_daily(1), pcp.conf(5) and
           pcp.env(5).
