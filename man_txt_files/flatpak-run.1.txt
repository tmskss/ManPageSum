    FLATPAK RUN(1)                 flatpak run                FLATPAK RUN(1)
## NAME         top
           flatpak-run - Run an application or open a shell in a runtime
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak run [OPTION...] REF [ARG...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           If REF names an installed application, Flatpak runs the
           application in a sandboxed environment. Extra arguments are
           passed on to the application. The current branch and arch of the
           application is used unless otherwise specified with --branch or
           --arch. See flatpak-make-current(1).
           If REF names a runtime, a shell is opened in the runtime. This is
           useful for development and testing. If there is ambiguity about
           which branch to use, you will be prompted to choose. Use --branch
           to avoid this. The primary arch is used unless otherwise
           specified with --arch.
           By default, Flatpak will look for the application or runtime in
           the per-user installation first, then in all system
           installations. This can be overridden with the --user, --system
           and --installation options.
           Flatpak creates a sandboxed environment for the application to
           run in by mounting the right runtime at /usr and a writable
           directory at /var, whose content is preserved between application
           runs. The application itself is mounted at /app.
           The details of the sandboxed environment are controlled by the
           application metadata and various options like --share and
           --socket that are passed to the run command: Access is allowed if
           it was requested either in the application metadata file or with
           an option and the user hasn't overridden it.
           The remaining arguments are passed to the command that gets run
           in the sandboxed environment. See the --file-forwarding option
           for handling of file arguments.
           Environment variables are generally passed on to the sandboxed
           application, with certain exceptions. The application metadata
           can override environment variables, as well as the --env option.
           Apart from that, Flatpak always unsets or overrides the following
           variables, since their session values are likely to interfere
           with the functioning of the sandbox:
               PATH
               LD_LIBRARY_PATH
               XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
               XDG_DATA_DIRS
               XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
               SHELL
               TEMP
               TEMPDIR
               TMP
               TMPDIR
               PYTHONPATH
               PERLLIB
               PERL5LIB
               XCURSOR_PATH
               KRB5CCNAME
               XKB_CONFIG_ROOT
               GIO_EXTRA_MODULES
               GDK_BACKEND
           Also several environment variables with the prefix "GST_" that
           are used by gstreamer are unset (since Flatpak 1.12.5).
           Flatpak also overrides the XDG environment variables to point
           sandboxed applications at their writable filesystem locations
           below ~/.var/app/$APPID/:
               XDG_DATA_HOME
               XDG_CONFIG_HOME
               XDG_CACHE_HOME
               XDG_STATE_HOME (since Flatpak 1.13)
           Apps can use the --persist=.local/state and
           --unset-env=XDG_STATE_HOME options to get a Flatpak
           1.13-compatible ~/.local/state on older versions of Flatpak.
           The host values of these variables are made available inside the
           sandbox via these HOST_-prefixed variables:
               HOST_XDG_DATA_HOME
               HOST_XDG_CONFIG_HOME
               HOST_XDG_CACHE_HOME
               HOST_XDG_STATE_HOME (since Flatpak 1.13)
           Flatpak sets the environment variable FLATPAK_ID to the
           application ID of the running app.
           Flatpak also bind-mounts as read-only the host's /etc/os-release
           (if available, or /usr/lib/os-release as a fallback) to
           /run/host/os-release in accordance with the os-release
           specification[1].
           If parental controls support is enabled, flatpak will check the
           current user’s parental controls settings, and will refuse to run
           an app if it is blocklisted for the current user.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -u, --user
               Look for the application and runtime in per-user
               installations.
           --system
               Look for the application and runtime in the default
               system-wide installations.
           --installation=NAME
               Look for the application and runtime in the system-wide
               installation specified by NAME among those defined in
               /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using --installation=default
               is equivalent to using --system.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
           --arch=ARCH
               The architecture to run. See flatpak --supported-arches for
               architectures supported by the host.
           --command=COMMAND
               The command to run instead of the one listed in the
               application metadata.
           --cwd=DIR
               The directory to run the command in. Note that this must be a
               directory inside the sandbox.
           --branch=BRANCH
               The branch to use.
           -d, --devel
               Use the devel runtime that is specified in the application
               metadata instead of the regular runtime, and use a seccomp
               profile that is less likely to break development tools.
           --runtime=RUNTIME
               Use this runtime instead of the one that is specified in the
               application metadata. This is a full tuple, like for example
               org.freedesktop.Sdk/x86_64/1.2, but partial tuples are
               allowed. Any empty or missing parts are filled in with the
               corresponding values specified by the app.
           --runtime-version=VERSION
               Use this version of the runtime instead of the one that is
               specified in the application metadata. This overrides any
               version specified with the --runtime option.
           --share=SUBSYSTEM
               Share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides the
               Context section from the application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM
               must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used
               multiple times.
           --unshare=SUBSYSTEM
               Don't share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides
               the Context section from the application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM
               must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used
               multiple times.
           --socket=SOCKET
               Expose a well known socket to the application. This overrides
               to the Context section from the application metadata.  SOCKET
               must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio,
               system-bus, session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent.
               This option can be used multiple times.
           --nosocket=SOCKET
               Don't expose a well known socket to the application. This
               overrides to the Context section from the application
               metadata.  SOCKET must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11,
               pulseaudio, system-bus, session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups,
               gpg-agent. This option can be used multiple times.
           --device=DEVICE
               Expose a device to the application. This overrides to the
               Context section from the application metadata.  DEVICE must
               be one of: dri, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used
               multiple times.
           --nodevice=DEVICE
               Don't expose a device to the application. This overrides to
               the Context section from the application metadata.  DEVICE
               must be one of: dri, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used
               multiple times.
           --allow=FEATURE
               Allow access to a specific feature. This overrides to the
               Context section from the application metadata.  FEATURE must
               be one of: devel, multiarch, bluetooth. This option can be
               used multiple times.
               See flatpak-build-finish(1) for the meaning of the various
               features.
           --disallow=FEATURE
               Disallow access to a specific feature. This overrides to the
               Context section from the application metadata.  FEATURE must
               be one of: devel, multiarch, bluetooth. This option can be
               used multiple times.
           --filesystem=FILESYSTEM
               Allow the application access to a subset of the filesystem.
               This overrides to the Context section from the application
               metadata.  FILESYSTEM can be one of: home, host, host-os,
               host-etc, xdg-desktop, xdg-documents, xdg-download,
               xdg-music, xdg-pictures, xdg-public-share, xdg-templates,
               xdg-videos, xdg-run, xdg-config, xdg-cache, xdg-data, an
               absolute path, or a homedir-relative path like ~/dir or paths
               relative to the xdg dirs, like xdg-download/subdir. The
               optional :ro suffix indicates that the location will be
               read-only. The optional :create suffix indicates that the
               location will be read-write and created if it doesn't exist.
               This option can be used multiple times. See the "[Context]
               filesystems" list in flatpak-metadata(5) for details of the
               meanings of these filesystems.
           --nofilesystem=FILESYSTEM
               Undo the effect of a previous --filesystem=FILESYSTEM in the
               app's manifest and/or the overrides set up with
               flatpak-override(1). This overrides the Context section of
               the application metadata.  FILESYSTEM can take the same
               values as for --filesystem, but the :ro and :create suffixes
               are not used here. This option can be used multiple times.
               This option does not prevent access to a more narrowly-scoped
               --filesystem. For example, if an application has the
               equivalent of --filesystem=xdg-config/MyApp in its manifest
               or as a system-wide override, and flatpak override --user
               --nofilesystem=home as a per-user override, then it will be
               prevented from accessing most of the home directory, but it
               will still be allowed to access $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/MyApp.
               As a special case, --nofilesystem=host:reset will ignore all
               --filesystem permissions inherited from the app manifest or
               flatpak-override(1), in addition to having the behaviour of
               --nofilesystem=host.
           --add-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE
               Add generic policy option. For example,
               "--add-policy=subsystem.key=v1 --add-policy=subsystem.key=v2"
               would map to this metadata:
                   [Policy subsystem]
                   key=v1;v2;
               This option can be used multiple times.
           --remove-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE
               Remove generic policy option. This option can be used
               multiple times.
           --env=VAR=VALUE
               Set an environment variable in the application. This
               overrides to the Context section from the application
               metadata. This option can be used multiple times.
           --unset-env=VAR
               Unset an environment variable in the application. This
               overrides the unset-environment entry in the [Context] group
               of the metadata, and the [Environment] group. This option can
               be used multiple times.
           --env-fd=FD
               Read environment variables from the file descriptor FD, and
               set them as if via --env. This can be used to avoid
               environment variables and their values becoming visible to
               other users.
               Each environment variable is in the form VAR=VALUE followed
               by a zero byte. This is the same format used by env -0 and
               /proc/*/environ.
           --own-name=NAME
               Allow the application to own the well known name NAME on the
               session bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the application
               to own all matching names. This overrides to the Context
               section from the application metadata. This option can be
               used multiple times.
           --talk-name=NAME
               Allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on
               the session bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the
               application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to
               the Context section from the application metadata. This
               option can be used multiple times.
           --no-talk-name=NAME
               Don't allow the application to talk to the well known name
               NAME on the session bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the
               application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to
               the Context section from the application metadata. This
               option can be used multiple times.
           --system-own-name=NAME
               Allow the application to own the well known name NAME on the
               system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the application
               to own all matching names. This overrides to the Context
               section from the application metadata. This option can be
               used multiple times.
           --system-talk-name=NAME
               Allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on
               the system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the
               application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to
               the Context section from the application metadata. This
               option can be used multiple times.
           --system-no-talk-name=NAME
               Don't allow the application to talk to the well known name
               NAME on the system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the
               application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to
               the Context section from the application metadata. This
               option can be used multiple times.
           --persist=FILENAME
               If the application doesn't have access to the real homedir,
               make the (homedir-relative) path FILENAME a bind mount to the
               corresponding path in the per-application directory, allowing
               that location to be used for persistent data. This overrides
               to the Context section from the application metadata. This
               option can be used multiple times.
           --no-session-bus
               Run this instance without the filtered access to the session
               dbus connection. Note, this is the default when run with
               --sandbox.
           --session-bus
               Allow filtered access to the session dbus connection. This is
               the default, except when run with --sandbox.
               In sandbox mode, even if you allow access to the session bus
               the sandbox cannot talk to or own the application ids
               (org.the.App.*) on the bus (unless explicitly added), only
               names in the .Sandboxed subset (org.the.App.Sandboxed.* and
               org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.org.the.App.Sandboxed.*).
           --no-a11y-bus
               Run this instance without the access to the accessibility
               bus. Note, this is the default when run with --sandbox.
           --a11y-bus
               Allow access to the accessibility bus. This is the default,
               except when run with --sandbox.
           --sandbox
               Run the application in sandboxed mode, which means dropping
               all the extra permissions it would otherwise have, as well as
               access to the session/system/a11y busses and document portal.
           --log-session-bus
               Log session bus traffic. This can be useful to see what
               access you need to allow in your D-Bus policy.
           --log-system-bus
               Log system bus traffic. This can be useful to see what access
               you need to allow in your D-Bus policy.
           -p, --die-with-parent
               Kill the entire sandbox when the launching process dies.
           --parent-pid=PID
               Specifies the pid of the "parent" flatpak, used by
               --parent-expose-pids and --parent-share-pids.
           --parent-expose-pids
               Make the processes of the new sandbox visible in the sandbox
               of the parent flatpak, as defined by --parent-pid.
           --parent-share-pids
               Use the same process ID namespace for the processes of the
               new sandbox and the sandbox of the parent flatpak, as defined
               by --parent-pid. Implies --parent-expose-pids.
           --instance-id-fd
               Write the instance ID string to the given file descriptor.
           --file-forwarding
               If this option is specified, the remaining arguments are
               scanned, and all arguments that are enclosed between a pair
               of '@@' arguments are interpreted as file paths, exported in
               the document store, and passed to the command in the form of
               the resulting document path. Arguments between '@@u' and '@@'
               are considered uris, and any file: uris are exported. The
               exports are non-persistent and with read and write
               permissions for the application.
           --app-path=PATH
               Instead of mounting the app's content on /app in the sandbox,
               mount PATH on /app, and the app's content on /run/parent/app.
               If the app has extensions, they will also be redirected into
               /run/parent/app, and will not be included in the
               LD_LIBRARY_PATH inside the sandbox.
           --app-path=
               As a special case, --app-path= (with an empty PATH) results
               in an empty directory being mounted on /app.
           --usr-path=PATH
               Instead of mounting the runtime's files on /usr in the
               sandbox, mount PATH on /usr, and the runtime's normal files
               on /run/parent/usr. If the runtime has extensions, they will
               also be redirected into /run/parent/usr, and will not be
               included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH inside the sandbox.  This
               option will usually only be useful if it is combined with
               --app-path= and --env=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=....
