## NAME         top
           localectl - Control the system locale and keyboard layout
           settings
## SYNOPSIS         top
           localectl [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}
## DESCRIPTION         top
           localectl may be used to query and change the system locale and
           keyboard layout settings. It communicates with systemd-localed(8)
           to modify files such as /etc/locale.conf and /etc/vconsole.conf.
           The system locale controls the language settings of system
           services and of the UI before the user logs in, such as the
           display manager, as well as the default for users after login.
           The keyboard settings control the keyboard layout used on the
           text console and of the graphical UI before the user logs in,
           such as the display manager, as well as the default for users
           after login.
           Note that the changes performed using this tool might require the
           initrd to be rebuilt to take effect during early system boot. The
           initrd is not rebuilt automatically by localectl, this task has
           to be performed manually, usually using a tool like dracut(8).
           Note that systemd-firstboot(1) may be used to initialize the
           system locale for mounted (but not booted) system images.
## COMMANDS         top
           The following commands are understood:
           status
               Show current settings of the system locale and keyboard
               mapping. If no command is specified, this is the implied
               default.
           set-locale LOCALE, set-locale VARIABLE=LOCALE...
               Set the system locale. This takes one locale such as
               "en_US.UTF-8", or takes one or more locale assignments such
               as "LANG=de_DE.utf8", "LC_MESSAGES=en_GB.utf8", and so on. If
               one locale without variable name is provided, then "LANG="
               locale variable will be set. See locale(7) for details on the
               available settings and their meanings. Use list-locales for a
               list of available locales (see below).
           list-locales
               List available locales useful for configuration with
               set-locale.
           set-keymap MAP [TOGGLEMAP]
               Set the system keyboard mapping for the console and X11. This
               takes a mapping name (such as "de" or "us"), and possibly a
               second one to define a toggle keyboard mapping. Unless
               --no-convert is passed, the selected setting is also applied
               as the default system keyboard mapping of X11, after
               converting it to the closest matching X11 keyboard mapping.
               Use list-keymaps for a list of available keyboard mappings
               (see below).
           list-keymaps
               List available keyboard mappings for the console, useful for
               configuration with set-keymap.
           set-x11-keymap LAYOUT [MODEL [VARIANT [OPTIONS]]]
               Set the system default keyboard mapping for X11 and the
               virtual console. This takes a keyboard mapping name (such as
               "de" or "us"), and possibly a model, variant, and options,
               see kbd(4) for details. Unless --no-convert is passed, the
               selected setting is also applied as the system console
               keyboard mapping, after converting it to the closest matching
               console keyboard mapping.
           list-x11-keymap-models, list-x11-keymap-layouts,
           list-x11-keymap-variants [LAYOUT], list-x11-keymap-options
               List available X11 keymap models, layouts, variants and
               options, useful for configuration with set-keymap. The
               command list-x11-keymap-variants optionally takes a layout
               parameter to limit the output to the variants suitable for
               the specific layout.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           --no-ask-password
               Do not query the user for authentication for privileged
               operations.
           --no-convert
               If set-keymap or set-x11-keymap is invoked and this option is
               passed, then the keymap will not be converted from the
               console to X11, or X11 to console, respectively.
           -H, --host=
               Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a
               username and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The
               hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is
               listening on, separated by ":", and then a container name,
               separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific
               container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to
               the remote machine manager instance. Container names may be
               enumerated with machinectl -H HOST. Put IPv6 addresses in
               brackets.
           -M, --machine=
               Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
               name to connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to
               connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special
               string ".host" is used in place of the container name, a
               connection to the local system is made (which is useful to
               connect to a specific user's user bus: "--user
               --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
               connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used
               either the left hand side or the right hand side may be
               omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and
               ".host" are implied.
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
           --no-pager
               Do not pipe output into a pager.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           $SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL
               The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a
               higher log level, i.e. less important ones, will be
               suppressed). Either one of (in order of decreasing
               importance) emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info,
               debug, or an integer in the range 0...7. See syslog(3) for
               more information.
           $SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR
               A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be
               colored according to priority.
               This setting is only useful when messages are written
               directly to the terminal, because journalctl(1) and other
               tools that display logs will color messages based on the log
               level on their own.
           $SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME
               A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed
               with a timestamp.
               This setting is only useful when messages are written
               directly to the terminal or a file, because journalctl(1) and
               other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on
               the entry metadata on their own.
           $SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION
               A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename
               and line number in the source code where the message
               originates.
               Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to
               journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
               text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.
           $SYSTEMD_LOG_TID
               A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the
               current numerical thread ID (TID).
               Note that the this information is attached as metadata to
               journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
               text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.
           $SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET
               The destination for log messages. One of console (log to the
               attached tty), console-prefixed (log to the attached tty but
               with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see
               syslog(3), kmsg (log to the kernel circular log buffer),
               journal (log to the journal), journal-or-kmsg (log to the
               journal if available, and to kmsg otherwise), auto (determine
               the appropriate log target automatically, the default), null
               (disable log output).
           $SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG
               Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults
               to "true". If disabled, systemd will not ratelimit messages
               written to kmsg.
           $SYSTEMD_PAGER
               Pager to use when --no-pager is not given; overrides $PAGER.
               If neither $SYSTEMD_PAGER nor $PAGER are set, a set of
               well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including
               less(1) and more(1), until one is found. If no pager
               implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting
               this environment variable to an empty string or the value
               "cat" is equivalent to passing --no-pager.
               Note: if $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set, $SYSTEMD_PAGER (as
               well as $PAGER) will be silently ignored.
           $SYSTEMD_LESS
               Override the options passed to less (by default "FRSXMK").
               Users might want to change two options in particular:
               K
                   This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when
                   Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow less to handle Ctrl+C itself
                   to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this
                   option.
                   If the value of $SYSTEMD_LESS does not include "K", and
                   the pager that is invoked is less, Ctrl+C will be ignored
                   by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.
               X
                   This option instructs the pager to not send termcap
                   initialization and deinitialization strings to the
                   terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to
                   remain visible in the terminal even after the pager
                   exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager
                   functionality from working, in particular paged output
                   cannot be scrolled with the mouse.
               See less(1) for more discussion.
           $SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET
               Override the charset passed to less (by default "utf-8", if
               the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).
           $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE
               Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the
               pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE
               is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective
               UID is not the same as the owner of the login session, see
               geteuid(2) and sd_pid_get_owner_uid(3). In secure mode,
               LESSSECURE=1 will be set when invoking the pager, and the
               pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or
               start new subprocesses. When $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE is not set
               at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode
               will not be used. (Currently only less(1) implements secure
               mode.)
               Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for
               example under sudo(8) or pkexec(1), care must be taken to
               ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled.
               "Secure" mode for the pager may be enabled automatically as
               describe above. Setting SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0 or not removing
               it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke
               arbitrary commands. Note that if the $SYSTEMD_PAGER or $PAGER
               variables are to be honoured, $SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE must be
               set too. It might be reasonable to completely disable the
               pager using --no-pager instead.
           $SYSTEMD_COLORS
               Takes a boolean argument. When true, systemd and related
               utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the
               output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can
               take one of the following special values: "16", "256" to
               restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
               respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic
               decision based on $TERM and what the console is connected to.
           $SYSTEMD_URLIFY
               The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links
               should be generated in the output for terminal emulators
               supporting this. This can be specified to override the
               decision that systemd makes based on $TERM and other
               conditions.
