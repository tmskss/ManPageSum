    TEST(1)                       User Commands                      TEST(1)
## NAME         top
           test - check file types and compare values
## SYNOPSIS         top
           test EXPRESSION
           test
           [ EXPRESSION ]
           [ ]
           [ OPTION
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Exit with the status determined by EXPRESSION.
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           An omitted EXPRESSION defaults to false.  Otherwise, EXPRESSION
           is true or false and sets exit status.  It is one of:
           ( EXPRESSION )
                  EXPRESSION is true
           ! EXPRESSION
                  EXPRESSION is false
           EXPRESSION1 -a EXPRESSION2
                  both EXPRESSION1 and EXPRESSION2 are true
           EXPRESSION1 -o EXPRESSION2
                  either EXPRESSION1 or EXPRESSION2 is true
           -n STRING
                  the length of STRING is nonzero
           STRING equivalent to -n STRING
           -z STRING
                  the length of STRING is zero
           STRING1 = STRING2
                  the strings are equal
           STRING1 != STRING2
                  the strings are not equal
           INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2
                  INTEGER1 is equal to INTEGER2
           INTEGER1 -ge INTEGER2
                  INTEGER1 is greater than or equal to INTEGER2
           INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2
                  INTEGER1 is greater than INTEGER2
           INTEGER1 -le INTEGER2
                  INTEGER1 is less than or equal to INTEGER2
           INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2
                  INTEGER1 is less than INTEGER2
           INTEGER1 -ne INTEGER2
                  INTEGER1 is not equal to INTEGER2
           FILE1 -ef FILE2
                  FILE1 and FILE2 have the same device and inode numbers
           FILE1 -nt FILE2
                  FILE1 is newer (modification date) than FILE2
           FILE1 -ot FILE2
                  FILE1 is older than FILE2
           -b FILE
                  FILE exists and is block special
           -c FILE
                  FILE exists and is character special
           -d FILE
                  FILE exists and is a directory
           -e FILE
                  FILE exists
           -f FILE
                  FILE exists and is a regular file
           -g FILE
                  FILE exists and is set-group-ID
           -G FILE
                  FILE exists and is owned by the effective group ID
           -h FILE
                  FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as -L)
           -k FILE
                  FILE exists and has its sticky bit set
           -L FILE
                  FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as -h)
           -N FILE
                  FILE exists and has been modified since it was last read
           -O FILE
                  FILE exists and is owned by the effective user ID
           -p FILE
                  FILE exists and is a named pipe
           -r FILE
                  FILE exists and the user has read access
           -s FILE
                  FILE exists and has a size greater than zero
           -S FILE
                  FILE exists and is a socket
           -t FD  file descriptor FD is opened on a terminal
           -u FILE
                  FILE exists and its set-user-ID bit is set
           -w FILE
                  FILE exists and the user has write access
           -x FILE
                  FILE exists and the user has execute (or search) access
           Except for -h and -L, all FILE-related tests dereference symbolic
           links.  Beware that parentheses need to be escaped (e.g., by
           backslashes) for shells.  INTEGER may also be -l STRING, which
           evaluates to the length of STRING.
           NOTE: Binary -a and -o are inherently ambiguous.  Use 'test EXPR1
           && test EXPR2' or 'test EXPR1 || test EXPR2' instead.
           NOTE: [ honors the --help and --version options, but test does
           not.  test treats each of those as it treats any other nonempty
           STRING.
           NOTE: your shell may have its own version of test and/or [, which
           usually supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to
           your shell's documentation for details about the options it
           supports.
