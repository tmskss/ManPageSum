## NAME         top
           pmerr - translate Performance Co-Pilot error codes into error
           messages
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmerr [-?]  code ...
           pmerr -l
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmerr accepts standard Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) error codes via
           the code argument(s) and generates the corresponding error text.
           Each code may be an integer, a hexadecimal value or a hexadecimal
           value prefixed by either ``0x'' or ``0X''.
           Error codes must be less than zero, so if code is a positive
           number, a warning message is produced, and the negated value is
           used.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -l, --list
                This alternative invocation causes all known error codes to
                be listed, along with their symbolic names and error text.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
