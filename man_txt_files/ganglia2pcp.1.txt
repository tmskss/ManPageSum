## NAME         top
           ganglia2pcp - import ganglia data and create a PCP archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ganglia2pcp [-d outdir] [-e end] [-f outfile] [-h hostname] [-s
           start] [-V version] [-Z timezone] input_dir
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ganglia2pcp is intended to read a set of ganglia files stored in
           the rrd format and translate them into a Performance Co-Pilot
           (PCP) archive with the basename outfile.
           The intent of this converter is to take all of the rrd files
           found in the input_dir and generate a single pcp archive file.
           The mapping of ganglia metrics to pcp metrics is defined
           internally.
           The resultant PCP achive may be used with all the PCP client
           tools to graph subsets of the data using pmchart(1), perform data
           reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
           pmie(1), etc.
           A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
           outfile.  These are outfile.0 (the performance data),
           outfile.meta (the metadata that describes the performance data)
           and outfile.index (a temporal index to improve efficiency of
           replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
           already, then sar2pcp will not overwrite them and will exit with
           an error message of the form
           __pmLogNewFile: ``blah.0'' already exists, not over-written
           ganglia2pcp is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
           wrapper around the PCP libpcp_import library, and as such could
           be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
           of performance data and create PCP archives.  The RRDs Perl
           wrapper is used to parse the raw rrd format files.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -d outdir
                The outdir argument specifies a output to write to.  The
                default is the current directory.
           -e end
                The end argument specifies a end time in a format understood
                by str2time.  The default start time is current time.
           -f outfile
                The outfile argument specifies a output file name.  The
                default name is in the standard pmlogger format based on the
                start time, e.g., 20150201.00.10.
           -h hostname
                The hostname argument specifies a hostname to write to the
                archive.  The default is taken from the directory name that
                the rrd files reside in.
           -s start
                The start argument specifies a start time in a format
                understood by str2time.  The default start time is 24 prior
                to current time.
           -V version
                The -V option specifies the version for the output PCP
                archive.  By default the archive version
                $PCP_ARCHIVE_VERSION (set to 2 in current PCP releases) is
                used, and the only values currently supported for version
                are 2 or 3.
           -Z timezone
                The timezone argument sets the source timezone in the PCP
                archive (the default is to use the local timezone).  The
                timezone must have the format +HHMM (for hours and minutes
                East of UTC) or -HHMM (for hours and minutes West of UTC) or
                UTC.  Note in particular that neither the zoneinfo (aka
                Olson) format, e.g. Europe/Paris, nor the Posix TZ format,
                e.g.  EST+5 is allowed.  Example: timezone=``+1100''.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
