    UUIDGEN(1)                    User Commands                   UUIDGEN(1)
## NAME         top
           uuidgen - create a new UUID value
## SYNOPSIS         top
           uuidgen [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The uuidgen program creates (and prints) a new universally unique
           identifier (UUID) using the libuuid(3) library. The new UUID can
           reasonably be considered unique among all UUIDs created on the
           local system, and among UUIDs created on other systems in the
           past and in the future.
           There are three types of UUIDs which uuidgen can generate:
           time-based UUIDs, random-based UUIDs, and hash-based UUIDs. By
           default uuidgen will generate a random-based UUID if a
           high-quality random number generator is present. Otherwise, it
           will choose a time-based UUID. It is possible to force the
           generation of one of these first two UUID types by using the
           --random or --time options.
           The third type of UUID is generated with the --md5 or --sha1
           options, followed by --namespace namespace and --name name. The
           namespace may either be a well-known UUID, or else an alias to
           one of the well-known UUIDs defined in RFC 4122, that is @dns,
           @url, @oid, or @x500. The name is an arbitrary string value. The
           generated UUID is the digest of the concatenation of the
           namespace UUID and the name value, hashed with the MD5 or SHA1
           algorithms. It is, therefore, a predictable value which may be
           useful when UUIDs are being used as handles or nonces for more
           complex values or values which shouldn’t be disclosed directly.
           See the RFC for more information.
## OPTIONS         top
           -r, --random
               Generate a random-based UUID. This method creates a UUID
               consisting mostly of random bits. It requires that the
               operating system has a high quality random number generator,
               such as /dev/random.
           -t, --time
               Generate a time-based UUID. This method creates a UUID based
               on the system clock plus the system’s ethernet hardware
               address, if present.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
           -m, --md5
               Use MD5 as the hash algorithm.
           -s, --sha1
               Use SHA1 as the hash algorithm.
           -n, --namespace namespace
               Generate the hash with the namespace prefix. The namespace is
               UUID, or '@ns' where "ns" is well-known predefined UUID
               addressed by namespace name (see above).
           -N, --name name
               Generate the hash of the name.
           -x, --hex
               Interpret name name as a hexadecimal string.
