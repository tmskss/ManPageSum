    DH_LINK(1)                      Debhelper                     DH_LINK(1)
## NAME         top
           dh_link - create symlinks in package build directories
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_link [debhelper options] [-A] [-Xitem]
           [source destination ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_link is a debhelper program that creates symlinks in package
           build directories.
           dh_link accepts a list of pairs of source and destination files.
           The source files are the already existing files that will be
           symlinked from (called target by ln(1)). The destination files
           are the symlinks that will be created (called link name by
           ln(1)). There must be an equal number of source and destination
           files specified.
           Be sure you do specify the absolute path to both the source and
           destination files (unlike you would do if you were using
           something like ln(1)).  Please note that the leading slash is
           optional.
           dh_link will generate symlinks that comply with Debian policy -
           absolute when policy says they should be absolute, and relative
           links with as short a path as possible. It will also create any
           subdirectories it needs to put the symlinks in.
           Any pre-existing destination files will be replaced with
           symlinks.
           dh_link also scans the package build tree for existing symlinks
           which do not conform to Debian policy, and corrects them (v4 or
           later).
## FILES         top
           debian/package.links
               Lists pairs of source and destination files to be symlinked.
               Each pair should be put on its own line, with the source and
               destination separated by whitespace.
               In each pair the source file (called target by ln(1)) comes
               first and is followed by the destination file (called link
               name by ln(1)). Thus the pairs of source and destination
               files in each line are given in the same order as they would
               be given to ln(1).
               In contrast to ln(1), source and destination paths must be
               absolute (the leading slash is optional).
               Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
               documented in debhelper(7).
## OPTIONS         top
           -A, --all
               Create any links specified by command line parameters in ALL
               packages acted on, not just the first.
           -Xitem, --exclude=item
               Exclude symlinks that contain item anywhere in their filename
               from being corrected to comply with Debian policy.
           source destination ...
               Create a file named destination as a link to a file named
               source. Do this in the package build directory of the first
               package acted on.  (Or in all packages if -A is specified.)
## EXAMPLES         top
            dh_link usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1
           Make bar.1 be a symlink to foo.1
            dh_link var/lib/foo usr/lib/foo \
              usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1
           Make /usr/lib/foo/ be a link to /var/lib/foo/, and bar.1 be a
           symlink to the foo.1
            var/lib/foo usr/lib/foo
            usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1
           Same as above but as content for a debian/package.links file.
