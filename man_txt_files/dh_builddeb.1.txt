# dh_builddeb(1) -- Linux manual page

    DH_BUILDDEB(1)                  Debhelper                 DH_BUILDDEB(1)
## NAME         top
           dh_builddeb - build Debian binary packages
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_builddeb [debhelper options] [--destdir=directory]
           [--filename=name] [-- params]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_builddeb simply calls dpkg-deb(1) to build a Debian package or
           packages.  It will also build dbgsym packages when dh_strip(1)
           and dh_gencontrol(1) have prepared them.
           It supports building multiple binary packages in parallel, when
           enabled by DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
           When the Rules-Requires-Root field is not (effectively) binary-
           targets, dh_builddeb will pass --root-owner-group to dpkg-deb(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           --destdir=directory
               Use this if you want the generated .deb files to be put in a
               directory other than the default of "..".
           --filename=name
               Use this if you want to force the generated .deb file to have
               a particular file name. Does not work well if more than one
               .deb is generated!
           -- params
               Pass params to dpkg-deb(1) when it is used to build the
               package.
           -uparams
               This is another way to pass params to dpkg-deb(1).  It is
               deprecated; use -- instead.
