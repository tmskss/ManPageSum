## NAME         top
           git-hook - Run git hooks
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git hook run [--ignore-missing] [--to-stdin=<path>] <hook-name> [-- <hook-args>]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           A command interface to running git hooks (see githooks(5)), for
           use by other scripted git commands.
## SUBCOMMANDS         top
           run
               Run the <hook-name> hook. See githooks(5) for supported hook
               names.
               Any positional arguments to the hook should be passed after a
               mandatory -- (or --end-of-options, see gitcli(7)). See
               githooks(5) for arguments hooks might expect (if any).
## OPTIONS         top
           --to-stdin
               For "run"; Specify a file which will be streamed into the
               hook’s stdin. The hook will receive the entire file from
               beginning to EOF.
           --ignore-missing
               Ignore any missing hook by quietly returning zero. Used for
               tools that want to do a blind one-shot run of a hook that may
               or may not be present.
