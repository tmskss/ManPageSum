## NAME         top
           pmdasystemd - systemd performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/systemd/pmdasystemd [-f] [-d domain] [-l logfile]
           [-m memory] [-s interval] [-U username]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdasystemd is a systemd log file monitoring Performance Metrics
           Domain Agent (PMDA).  It can be seen as analagous to the -f
           option to journalctl(1) and converts each new log line into a
           performance event, suitable for consumption by PMAPI(3) client
           tools like pmevent(1).
           The systemd PMDA exports both event-style metrics reflecting
           timestamped event records for messages logged to the system logs,
           as well as the more orthodox sample-style metrics such as message
           counts and throughput size values.
           A brief description of the pmdasystemd command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -f   Disables per-uid/gid record filtering.  By default the user
                and group credentials will be used to filter log records
                returned to the client tool, preventing information exposure
                to arbitrary users.  This option disables that, so use only
                with extreme caution.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                systemd.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdasystemd is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If
                the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -m   Limit the physical memory used by the PMDA to buffer event
                records to maxsize bytes.  As log events arrive at the PMDA,
                they must be buffered until individual client tools request
                the next batch since their previous batch of events.  The
                default maximum is 2 megabytes.
           -s   Sets the polling interval for detecting newly arrived log
                lines.  Mirrors the same option from the tail(1) command.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the "adm" user account.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           systemd performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/systemd
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/systemd
                # ./Remove
           pmdasystemd is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdasystemd
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
