## NAME         top
           setmetamode - define the keyboard meta key handling
## SYNOPSIS         top
           setmetamode [ options ] [ argument ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Without argument, setmetamode prints the current Meta key mode.
           With argument, it sets the Meta key mode as indicated.  The
           setting before and after the change are reported.
           The Meta key mode is specific for each VT (and the VT
           corresponding to stdin is used).  One might use setmetamode in
           /etc/rc to define the initial state of the Meta key mode, e.g. by
                INITTY=/dev/tty[1-8]
                for tty in $INITTY; do
                     setmetamode escprefix < $tty
                done
## ARGUMENTS         top
           esc, prefix, escprefix
                  The Meta key sends an Escape prefix.
           meta, bit, metabit
                  The Meta key sets the high order bit of the character.
## OPTIONS         top
           -C, --console=DEV
                  the console device to be used;
           -V, --version
                  print version number;
           -h, --help
                  print this usage message.
