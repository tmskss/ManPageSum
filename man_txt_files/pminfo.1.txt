## NAME         top
           pminfo - display information about performance metrics
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pminfo [-dfFIlLmMstTvVxz?]  [-a archive] [-b batchsize] [-c
           dmfile] [--container name] [-h hostname] [-K spec] [-[n|N]
           pmnsfile] [-O time] [-Z timezone] [metricname | pmid | indom]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pminfo displays various types of information about performance
           metrics available through the facilities of the Performance Co-
           Pilot (PCP).
           The metrics of interest are named in the metricname arguments.
           If metricname is a non-leaf node in the PMNS, then pminfo will
           recursively descend the PMNS and report on all leaf nodes.  If no
           metricname argument is given, the root of the PMNS is used.
           If the metricname argument is in numeric dotted notation, it is
           interpreted as either a 3-dotted pmid (metric identifier -
           domain, cluster, item numbers) or a 2-dotted indom (instance
           domain identifier - domain, serial number).  In the pmid case, a
           reverse PMID-to-name lookup is performed, and in the indom case,
           the instance domain is reported directly.  This latter mode can
           be used to report the instance domain ``one line'' and long form
           help text summaries.
           Unless directed to another host by the -h option, by default
           pminfo will contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
           (PMCD) on the local host.  The connection to a PMCD is only
           required if pminfo requires distributed PMNS information, and/or
           meta-data describing metrics, and/or metric values, and/or help
           text.
           The -a option causes pminfo to use the specified set of archives
           rather than connecting to a PMCD.
           The -L option causes pminfo to use a local context to collect
           metrics from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD.  Only some
           metrics are available in this mode.
           The -a, -h and -L options are mutually exclusive.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a archive, --archive=archive
                Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
                Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log files identified by
                the archive argument, which is a comma-separated list of
                names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
                the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
           -b, --batch
                This option may be used to define the maximum number of
                metrics to be fetched in a single request for the -f and -v
                options.  The default value for batchsize is 128.
           -c dmfile, --derived=dmfile
                The dmfile argument specifies a file that contains derived
                metric definitions in the format described for
                pmLoadDerivedConfig(3).  The -c option provides a way to
                load derived metric definitions that is an alternative to
                the more generic use of the PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment
                variable as described in PCPIntro(1).  Using the -c option
                and the PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment variable to specify
                the same configuration is a bad idea, so choose one or the
                other method.
           --container=container
                Specify an individual container to be queried.
           -d, --desc
                Metric descriptions detailing the PMID, data type, data
                semantics, units, scale and associated instance domain.
           -f, --fetch
                Fetch and print values for all instances.  When fetching
                from a set of archives, only those instances present in the
                first archive record for a metric will be displayed; see
                also the -O option, else use pmdumplog(1) which may be a
                better tool for examining archives.
           -F, --fetchall
                Same as -f but try harder to fetch instances for metrics
                which have non-enumerable instance domains (e.g. metrics in
                the ``proc'' subtree of the default PMNS on some platforms).
           -h host, --host=host
                Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather than
                from the default localhost.
           -I, --fullindom
                Print the InDom in verbose mode.
           -K spec, --spec-local=spec
                When using the -L/ option to fetch metrics from a local
                context, this option controls the DSO PMDAs that should be
                made accessible.  The spec argument conforms to the syntax
                described in pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).  More than one -K option
                may be used.
           -l, --labels
                Print label sets associated with metrics and instances.
                Labels are optional metric metadata described in detail in
                pmLookupLabels(3).
           -L, --local-PMDA
                Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the
                local host without PMCD.  See also -K.
           -m, --pmid
                Print the PMID in terse mode.
           -M, --fullpmid
                Print the PMID in verbose mode.
           -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
                Normally pminfo operates on the distributed Performance
                Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
                specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file
                pmnsfile.
           -N pmnsfile, --uniqnames=pmnsfile
                The -N option supports the same function as -n, except for
                the handling of duplicate names for the same Performance
                Metric Identifier (PMID) in pmnsfile - duplicate names are
                allowed with -n but they are not allowed with -N.
           -O time, --origin=time
                When used in conjunction with an archive source of metrics
                and the options -f/, the time argument defines a time origin
                at which the metrics should be fetched from the set of
                archives.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description
                of this option, and the syntax for the time argument.
           -s, --series
                Print time series identifiers associated with metrics,
                instances and sources.  These unique identifiers are
                calculated from intrinsic (non-optional) labels and other
                metric metadata associated with each PMAPI context
                (sources), metrics and instances.  Archive, local context or
                pmcd(1) connections for the same host all produce the same
                source identifier.  See also pmLookupLabels(3) and the -l
                option.
           -t, --oneline
                Print the ``one line'' help summary, if available.
           -T, --helptext
                Print the help text, if available.
           -v, --verify
                Verify mode in which descriptions and values are retrieved,
                but only error conditions are reported.  This option
                silently disables any output from the options -f/--fetch,
                -l/--labels, -I/--fullindom, -M/--fullpmid, -m/--pmid,
                -t/--oneline and -T/--helptext.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -x, --events
                Like the -f/--fetch option, but with the additional
                functionality that if a value is processed that is of type
                PM_TYPE_EVENT or PM_TYPE_HIGHRES_EVENT, then the event
                records will be unpacked and the details of each event
                record reported.
           -z, --hostzone
                Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
                host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
                identified via either the -h or -a options.
           -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
                By default, pminfo reports the time of day according to the
                local timezone on the system where pminfo is run.  The -Z
                option changes the timezone to timezone in the format of the
                environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/*
                default local PMNS specification files
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
