## NAME         top
           dpkg-statoverride - override ownership and mode of files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dpkg-statoverride [option...] command
## DESCRIPTION         top
           “stat overrides” are a way to tell dpkg(1) to use a different
           owner or mode for a path when a package is installed (this
           applies to any filesystem object that dpkg handles, including
           directories, devices, etc.). This can be used to force programs
           that are normally setuid to be install without a setuid flag, or
           only executable by a certain group.
           dpkg-statoverride is a utility to manage the list of stat
           overrides. It has three basic functions: adding, removing and
           listing overrides.
## COMMANDS         top
           --add user group mode path
               Add an override for path. path does not need to exist nor be
               known to dpkg when this command is used; the override will be
               stored and used later.  Users and groups can be specified by
               their name (for example root or nobody), or by their number
               by prepending the number with a ‘#’ (for example #0 or
               #65534).  The mode needs to be specified in octal.
               If --update is specified and path exists, it is immediately
               set to the new owner and mode.
           --remove path
               Remove an override for path, the status of path is left
               unchanged by this command.
           --list [glob-pattern]
               List all overrides. If a glob pattern is specified restrict
               the output to overrides which match the glob.
           --help
               Show the usage message and exit.
           --force-help
               Give help about the --force-thing options (since dpkg
               1.19.5).
           --version
               Show the version and exit.
## OPTIONS         top
           --admindir directory
               Set the administrative directory to directory.  This is where
               the statoverride file is stored.  Defaults to
               «/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» if DPKG_ADMINDIR has not been set.
           --instdir directory
               Set the installation directory, which refers to the directory
               where packages get installed (since dpkg 1.19.2).  Defaults
               to «/» if DPKG_ROOT has not been set.
           --root directory
               Set the root directory to directory, which sets the
               installation directory to «directory» and the administrative
               directory to «directory/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» (since dpkg
               1.19.2) if DPKG_ROOT has not been set.
           --force-things
           --no-force-things, --refuse-things
               Force or refuse (no-force and refuse mean the same thing) to
               do some things (since dpkg 1.19.5).  things is a comma
               separated list of things specified below.  --force-help
               displays a message describing them.  Things marked with (*)
               are forced by default.
               Warning: These options are mostly intended to be used by
               experts only.  Using them without fully understanding their
               effects may break your whole system.
               all:
                   Turns on (or off) all force options.
               statoverride-add:
                   Overwrite an existing stat override when adding it (since
                   dpkg 1.19.5).
               statoverride-remove:
                   Ignore a missing stat override when removing it (since
                   dpkg 1.19.5).
               security-mac(*):
                   Use platform-specific Mandatory Access Controls (MAC)
                   based security when installing files into the filesystem
                   (since dpkg 1.19.5).  On Linux systems the implementation
                   uses SELinux.
               not-root:
                   Try to (de)install things even when not root (since dpkg
                   1.21.8).
           --force
               Force an action, even if a sanity check would otherwise
               prohibit it.  This is necessary to override an existing
               override.  This option is deprecated (since dpkg 1.19.5), it
               is replaced by --force-all.
           --update
               Immediately try to change the path to the new owner and mode
               if it exists.
           --quiet
               Be less verbose about what we do.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0   The requested action was successfully performed.
           1   For --list, if there are no overrides or none match the
               supplied glob.
           2   Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
               usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to
               the database, memory allocations, etc.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           DPKG_ROOT
               If set and the --instdir or --root options have not been
               specified, it will be used as the filesystem root directory
               (since dpkg 1.19.2).
           DPKG_ADMINDIR
               If set and the --admindir or --root options have not been
               specified, it will be used as the dpkg data directory.
           DPKG_DEBUG
               Sets the debug mask (since dpkg 1.21.10) from an octal value.
               The currently accepted flags are described in the dpkg
               --debug option, but not all these flags might have an effect
               on this program.
           DPKG_FORCE
               If set and none of the --force-... options have been
               specified, it will be used as the force options to use (since
               dpkg 1.19.5).
           DPKG_COLORS
               Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
               accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.
## FILES         top
           /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/statoverride
               File which contains the current list of stat overrides of the
               system. It is located in the dpkg administration directory,
               along with other files important to dpkg, such as status or
               available.
               Note: dpkg-statoverride preserves the old copy of this file,
               with extension “-old”, before replacing it with the new one.
