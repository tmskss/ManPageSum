    DH_INSTALLTMPFILES(1)           Debhelper          DH_INSTALLTMPFILES(1)
## NAME         top
           dh_installtmpfiles - install tmpfiles.d configuration files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installtmpfiles [debhelper options][--name=name]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installtmpfiles is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           installing package maintainer supplied tmpfiles.d configuration
           files (e.g. for systemd-tmpfiles).
           It also finds the tmpfiles.d configuration files installed by a
           package and generates postinst code blocks for activating the
           tmpfiles.d configuration when the package is installed. These
           snippets are added to the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           --name=name
               This option controls both a prefix used for lookng up
               maintainer provided tmpfiles.d configuration files (those
               mentioned in the "FILES" section) and also the base name used
               for the installed version of the file.
## FILES         top
           debian/package.tmpfiles
               If this exists, it is installed into usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ in
               the package build directory. Note that the "tmpfiles.d"
               mechanism is currently only used by systemd.
           debian/package.tmpfile
               Deprecated name for debian/package.tmpfiles.
## NOTES         top
           This command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
           between invocations of this command (with the same arguments).
           Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be
           added to maintainer scripts.
