    CHFN(1)                       User Commands                      CHFN(1)
## NAME         top
           chfn - change your finger information
## SYNOPSIS         top
           chfn [-f full-name] [-o office] [-p office-phone] [-h home-phone]
           [-u] [-V] [username]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           chfn is used to change your finger information. This information
           is stored in the /etc/passwd file, and is displayed by the finger
           program. The Linux finger command will display four pieces of
           information that can be changed by chfn: your real name, your
           work room and phone, and your home phone.
           Any of the four pieces of information can be specified on the
           command line. If no information is given on the command line,
           chfn enters interactive mode.
           In interactive mode, chfn will prompt for each field. At a
           prompt, you can enter the new information, or just press return
           to leave the field unchanged. Enter the keyword "none" to make
           the field blank.
           chfn supports non-local entries (kerberos, LDAP, etc.) if linked
           with libuser, otherwise use ypchfn(1), lchfn(1) or any other
           implementation for non-local entries.
## OPTIONS         top
           -f, --full-name full-name
               Specify your real name.
           -o, --office office
               Specify your office room number.
           -p, --office-phone office-phone
               Specify your office phone number.
           -h, --home-phone home-phone
               Specify your home phone number.
           -u, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit. The short options -V have been used
               since version 2.39; old versions use deprecated -v.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## CONFIG FILE ITEMS         top
           chfn reads the /etc/login.defs configuration file (see
           login.defs(5)). Note that the configuration file could be
           distributed with another package (e.g., shadow-utils). The
           following configuration items are relevant for chfn:
           CHFN_RESTRICT string
               Indicate which fields are changeable by chfn.
               The boolean setting "yes" means that only the Office, Office
               Phone and Home Phone fields are changeable, and boolean
               setting "no" means that also the Full Name is changeable.
               Another way to specify changeable fields is by abbreviations:
               f = Full Name, r = Office (room), w = Office (work) Phone, h
               = Home Phone. For example, CHFN_RESTRICT "wh" allows changing
               work and home phone numbers.
               If CHFN_RESTRICT is undefined, then all finger information is
               read-only. This is the default.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           Returns 0 if operation was successful, 1 if operation failed or
           command syntax was not valid.
