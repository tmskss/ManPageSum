## NAME         top
           lprm - cancel print jobs
## SYNOPSIS         top
           lprm [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -P
           destination[/instance] ] [ - ] [ job-id(s) ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           lprm cancels print jobs that have been queued for printing.  If
           no arguments are supplied, the current job on the default
           destination is canceled.  You can specify one or more job ID
           numbers to cancel those jobs or use the - option to cancel all
           jobs.
## OPTIONS         top
           The lprm command supports the following options:
           -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.
           -P destination[/instance]
                Specifies the destination printer or class.
           -U username
                Specifies an alternate username.
           -h server[:port]
                Specifies an alternate server.
## CONFORMING TO         top
           The CUPS version of lprm is compatible with the standard Berkeley
           command of the same name.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Cancel the current job on the default printer:
               lprm
           Cancel job 1234:
               lprm 1234
           Cancel all jobs:
               lprm -
