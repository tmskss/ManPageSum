## NAME         top
           callgrind_annotate - post-processing tool for the Callgrind
## SYNOPSIS         top
           callgrind_annotate [options]
                              [callgrind-out-file [source-files...]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           callgrind_annotate takes an output file produced by the Valgrind
           tool Callgrind and prints the information in an easy-to-read
           form.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h --help
               Show summary of options.
           --version
               Show version of callgrind_annotate.
           --show=A,B,C [default: all]
               Only show figures for events A,B,C.
           --threshold=<0--100> [default: 99%]
               Percentage of counts (of primary sort event) we are
               interested in.
               callgrind_annotate stops printing functions when the sum of
               the cost percentage of the printed functions is bigger or
               equal to the given threshold percentage.
           --sort=A,B,C
               Sort columns by events A,B,C [event column order].
               Optionally, each event is followed by a : and a threshold, to
               specify different thresholds depending on the event.
               callgrind_annotate stops printing functions when the sum of
               the cost percentage of the printed functions for all the
               events is bigger or equal to the given event threshold
               percentages.
               When one or more thresholds are given via this option, the
               value of --threshold is ignored.
           --show-percs=<no|yes> [default: no]
               When enabled, a percentage is printed next to all event
               counts. This helps gauge the relative importance of each
               function and line.
           --auto=<yes|no> [default: yes]
               Annotate all source files containing functions that helped
               reach the event count threshold.
           --context=N [default: 8]
               Print N lines of context before and after annotated lines.
           --inclusive=<yes|no> [default: no]
               Add subroutine costs to functions calls.
           --tree=<none|caller|calling|both> [default: none]
               Print for each function their callers, the called functions
               or both.
           -I, --include=<dir>
               Add dir to the list of directories to search for source
               files.
