## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-clear - clear the Ftrace buffer.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd clear [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) clear clears the content of the Ftrace ring
           buffer.
## OPTIONS         top
           -B buffer-name
               If the kernel supports multiple buffers, this will clear only
               the given buffer. It does not affect any other buffers. This
               may be used multiple times to specify different buffers. The
               top level buffer will not be clearded if this option is
               given.
           -a
               Clear all existing buffers, including the top level one.
