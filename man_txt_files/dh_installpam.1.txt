## NAME         top
           dh_installpam - install pam support files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installpam [debhelper options] [--name=name]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installpam is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           installing files used by PAM into package build directories.
## FILES         top
           debian/package.pam
               Installed into usr/lib/pam.d/package in the package build
               directory.
               Until compatibility level 14 this file was installed under
               etc/pam.d/package. Please consider using the "rm_conffile"
               feature from dh_installdeb(1) to ensure the proper removal of
               previous PAM files.
## OPTIONS         top
           --name=name
               Look for files named debian/package.name.pam and install them
               as usr/lib/pam.d/name, instead of using the usual files and
               installing them using the package name.
## SEE ALSO         top
           debhelper(7)
           This program is a part of debhelper.
