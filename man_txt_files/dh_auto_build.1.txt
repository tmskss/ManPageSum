## NAME         top
           dh_auto_build - automatically builds a package
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_auto_build [build system options] [debhelper options]
           [-- params]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_auto_build is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
           build a package. It does so by running the appropriate command
           for the build system it detects the package uses. For example, if
           a Makefile is found, this is done by running make (or MAKE, if
           the environment variable is set). If there's a setup.py, or
           Build.PL, it is run to build the package.
           This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
           work, you're encouraged to skip using dh_auto_build at all, and
           just run the build process manually.
## OPTIONS         top
           See "BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS" in debhelper(7) for a list of common
           build system selection and control options.
           -- params
               Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters
               that dh_auto_build usually passes.
## SEE ALSO         top
           debhelper(7)
           This program is a part of debhelper.
