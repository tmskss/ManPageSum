    GIT-BUGREPORT(1)               Git Manual               GIT-BUGREPORT(1)
## NAME         top
           git-bugreport - Collect information for user to file a bug report
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git bugreport [(-o | --output-directory) <path>] [(-s | --suffix) <format>]
                           [--diagnose[=<mode>]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Captures information about the user’s machine, Git client, and
           repository state, as well as a form requesting information about
           the behavior the user observed, into a single text file which the
           user can then share, for example to the Git mailing list, in
           order to report an observed bug.
           The following information is requested from the user:
           •   Reproduction steps
           •   Expected behavior
           •   Actual behavior
           The following information is captured automatically:
           •   git version --build-options
           •   uname sysname, release, version, and machine strings
           •   Compiler-specific info string
           •   A list of enabled hooks
           •   $SHELL
           Additional information may be gathered into a separate zip
           archive using the --diagnose option, and can be attached
           alongside the bugreport document to provide additional context to
           readers.
           This tool is invoked via the typical Git setup process, which
           means that in some cases, it might not be able to launch - for
           example, if a relevant config file is unreadable. In this kind of
           scenario, it may be helpful to manually gather the kind of
           information listed above when manually asking for help.
## OPTIONS         top
           -o <path>, --output-directory <path>
               Place the resulting bug report file in <path> instead of the
               current directory.
           -s <format>, --suffix <format>
               Specify an alternate suffix for the bugreport name, to create
               a file named git-bugreport-<formatted suffix>. This should
               take the form of a strftime(3) format string; the current
               local time will be used.
           --no-diagnose, --diagnose[=<mode>]
               Create a zip archive of supplemental information about the
               user’s machine, Git client, and repository state. The archive
               is written to the same output directory as the bug report and
               is named git-diagnostics-<formatted suffix>.
               Without mode specified, the diagnostic archive will contain
               the default set of statistics reported by git diagnose. An
               optional mode value may be specified to change which
               information is included in the archive. See git-diagnose(1)
               for the list of valid values for mode and details about their
               usage.
