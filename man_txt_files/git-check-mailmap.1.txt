## NAME         top
           git-check-mailmap - Show canonical names and email addresses of
           contacts
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git check-mailmap [<options>] <contact>...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           For each “Name <user@host>” or “<user@host>” from the
           command-line or standard input (when using --stdin), look up the
           person’s canonical name and email address (see "Mapping Authors"
           below). If found, print them; otherwise print the input as-is.
## OPTIONS         top
           --stdin
               Read contacts, one per line, from the standard input after
               exhausting contacts provided on the command-line.
## OUTPUT         top
           For each contact, a single line is output, terminated by a
           newline. If the name is provided or known to the mailmap, “Name
           <user@host>” is printed; otherwise only “<user@host>” is printed.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           See mailmap.file and mailmap.blob in git-config(1) for how to
           specify a custom .mailmap target file or object.
