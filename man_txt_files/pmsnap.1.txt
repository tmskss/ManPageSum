## NAME         top
           pmsnap - generate performance summary snapshot images
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsnap [-NV?]  [-c configs] [-C dir] [-f format]
           [-n names] [-o dir]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmsnap is a shell script that is normally run periodically from
           crontab(1) to generate graphic images of pmchart(1) performance
           charts.  These images can be in any of the supported pmchart
           formats, including png, bmp, and jpeg, and may be incorporated
           into the content offered by the local web server.  By default
           pmsnap generates no textual output unless some error or warning
           condition is encountered.
           pmsnap generates images according to its control file,
           $PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH (or dir/control if the -C option is
           specified), and uses archive logs created by pmlogger(1) or PCP
           archive folios created by pmafm(1) and pmlogger_check(1).  Before
           attempting to configure pmsnap, it is strongly recommended that
           pmlogger be configured according to the descriptions in
           pmlogger_daily(1), pmlogger_check(1) and pmlogger(1).
           Once pmlogger has been configured, it is necessary to configure
           pmsnap as follows;
           1.     Edit the control file $PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH.  The syntax
                  of this file is described in the comment at the head of
                  the file and an example is supplied for one and twelve
                  hour "Summary" performance charts for the local host.
                  Suitable arguments for pmchart are also described in the
                  comment.  The user should consult pmchart for further
                  details.  Note that when pmsnap is run, it globally
                  substitutes the string LOCALHOSTNAME with the name of the
                  local host in the control file.
           2.     Test the configuration by running
                                   $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsnap.
                  Without any arguments pmsnap will process every non-
                  comment line in $PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH.  The output
                  images will be placed in the files named in the first
                  field of each line in the control file, with the file
                  format appended if necessary.  If these file names do not
                  start with / or .  then they are assumed relative to dir,
                  as specified with the -o option.  The default dir is the
                  current directory.  Note that if pmlogger has only been
                  recently started (within about the last 15 minutes),
                  snapshot images may not be produced and no error messages
                  will be issued - the reason is that pmchart can not use
                  very short archives and hence, neither can pmsnap.  For
                  debugging purposes the -V flag should be used.
           3.     Add an appropriate entry for pmsnap in the root user's
                  crontab.  An example is supplied in
                  $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/crontab.
           4.     Incorporate the pmsnap images into the local WWW content.
                  Usually, WWW pages use images that are relative to a
                  particular document root, so it is often convenient to use
                  the -o command line option to specify a sub-directory of
                  the local WWW content, and then create a web page in this
                  directory that shows the snapshot images with text and
                  other content appropriate to the local environment.
           A sample HTML page, suitable for the Summary snapshot may be
           found in $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmsnap/Summary.html.
           Although pmsnap attempts to flush stdio(3) output buffers in the
           relevant pmlogger processes before generating snapshots images,
           this may fail for assorted reasons and no error message will be
           given.
           pmsnap should not be invoked immediately after pmlogger_daily has
           rolled the logs because the new archive logs will be too short to
           obtain meaningful results.  Note however that pmsnap will not
           report errors from pmchart about not being able to comply with
           the -A option on very short archives.  In these cases no error
           will be reported and no output images will be produced.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -c config-pattern
                Only process lines in the control file which match the
                config-pattern regular expression in the Config column.
           -C dir
                The control file is located in the directory dir rather than
                in the default $PCP_PMSNAPCONTROL_PATH location.
           -f format
                Set output image format.  The defaults format is png.
           -n name-pattern
                Only process lines in the control file which match the name-
                pattern regular expression (see egrep(1)) in the Name
                column.
           -N   Enable a ``show me'' mode, where the actions are echoed, but
                not executed, in the style of ``make -n''.  Using -N in
                conjunction with -V maximizes the diagnostic capabilities
                for debugging.
           -o dir
                The output images having file names which do not start with
                / or .  will be placed in a directory relative to dir,
                otherwise the output directory is relative to the current
                directory (i.e. the default value for dir is ./).  Note that
                dir must be a writable directory path and may be on an NFS
                or CIFS file system.
           -V   Enable verbose mode.
           -?   Display usage message and exit.
           When either -n or -c are used, pmsnap will only process lines in
           the control file which match all the supplied patterns.  If no
           patterns are given, then all lines will be processed.  These
           arguments allow multiple entries for pmsnap in crontab so that
           different performance summary images can be generated at
           different times or with different frequencies.
