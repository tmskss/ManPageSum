    CHGRP(1)                      User Commands                     CHGRP(1)
## NAME         top
           chgrp - change group ownership
## SYNOPSIS         top
           chgrp [OPTION]... GROUP FILE...
           chgrp [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Change the group of each FILE to GROUP.  With --reference, change
           the group of each FILE to that of RFILE.
           -c, --changes
                  like verbose but report only when a change is made
           -f, --silent, --quiet
                  suppress most error messages
           -v, --verbose
                  output a diagnostic for every file processed
           --dereference
                  affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the
                  default), rather than the symbolic link itself
           -h, --no-dereference
                  affect symbolic links instead of any referenced file
                  (useful only on systems that can change the ownership of a
                  symlink)
           --no-preserve-root
                  do not treat '/' specially (the default)
           --preserve-root
                  fail to operate recursively on '/'
           --reference=RFILE
                  use RFILE's group rather than specifying a GROUP.  RFILE
                  is always dereferenced if a symbolic link.
           -R, --recursive
                  operate on files and directories recursively
           The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when
           the -R option is also specified.  If more than one is specified,
           only the final one takes effect.
           -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a
                  directory, traverse it
           -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered
           -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
## EXAMPLES         top
           chgrp staff /u
                  Change the group of /u to "staff".
           chgrp -hR staff /u
                  Change the group of /u and subfiles to "staff".
