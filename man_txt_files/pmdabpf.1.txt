## NAME         top
           pmdabpf - eBPF PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdabpf is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics
           Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts live performance data from
           eBPF programs utilizing BPF CO-RE (libbpf and BTF).
           pmdabpf loads and acts as a bridge for any number of configured,
           separate bpf PMDA modules. Existing libbpf tools should be
           possible to be utilized with the bpf PMDA modules with reasonable
           effort.
           See the eBPF, libbpf and BPF CO-RE documentation for detailed
           descriptions.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           pmdabpf reads a mandatory ini-style configuration file:
                  $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpf/bpf.conf
           Each section of the file corresponds to one bpf PMDA module.  The
           following global options are available for every module (their
           default values are shown in parenthesis):
           enabled (unset)
                  A boolean value to specify whether this bpf PMDA module
                  should be started or not.
           Modules may also support additional module-specific configuration
           options, refer to the default configuration file for their
           supported options.
## INSTALLATION         top
           To install, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpf
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpf
               # ./Remove
           pmdabpf is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
           Some modules will start providing values only after having
           collected data from related system activity.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpf/bpf.conf
                configuration file for the pmdabpf agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpf/modules/*.{o,so}
                bpf PMDA modules available for the pmdabpf agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpf/Install
                installation script for the pmdabpf agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpf/Remove
                undo installation script for the pmdabpf agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/bpf.log
                default log file for messages from the pmdabpf agent
           Note that the usual/default value for $PCP_PMDAS_DIR is
           /var/lib/pcp/pmdas and the default for $PCP_LOG_DIR is
           /var/log/pcp but these settings are platform dependent.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
