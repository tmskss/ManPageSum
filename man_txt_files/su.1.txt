    SU(1)                         User Commands                        SU(1)
## NAME         top
           su - run a command with substitute user and group ID
## SYNOPSIS         top
           su [options] [-] [user [argument...]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           su allows commands to be run with a substitute user and group ID.
           When called with no user specified, su defaults to running an
           interactive shell as root. When user is specified, additional
           arguments can be supplied, in which case they are passed to the
           shell.
           For backward compatibility, su defaults to not change the current
           directory and to only set the environment variables HOME and
           SHELL (plus USER and LOGNAME if the target user is not root). It
           is recommended to always use the --login option (instead of its
           shortcut -) to avoid side effects caused by mixing environments.
           This version of su uses PAM for authentication, account and
           session management. Some configuration options found in other su
           implementations, such as support for a wheel group, have to be
           configured via PAM.
           su is mostly designed for unprivileged users, the recommended
           solution for privileged users (e.g., scripts executed by root) is
           to use non-set-user-ID command runuser(1) that does not require
           authentication and provides separate PAM configuration. If the
           PAM session is not required at all then the recommended solution
           is to use command setpriv(1).
           Note that su in all cases uses PAM (pam_getenvlist(3)) to do the
           final environment modification. Command-line options such as
           --login and --preserve-environment affect the environment before
           it is modified by PAM.
           Since version 2.38 su resets process resource limits RLIMIT_NICE,
           RLIMIT_RTPRIO, RLIMIT_FSIZE, RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_NOFILE.
## OPTIONS         top
           -c, --command=command
               Pass command to the shell with the -c option.
           -f, --fast
               Pass -f to the shell, which may or may not be useful,
               depending on the shell.
           -g, --group=group
               Specify the primary group. This option is available to the
               root user only.
           -G, --supp-group=group
               Specify a supplementary group. This option is available to
               the root user only. The first specified supplementary group
               is also used as a primary group if the option --group is not
               specified.
           -, -l, --login
               Start the shell as a login shell with an environment similar
               to a real login:
               •   clears all the environment variables except TERM and
                   variables specified by --whitelist-environment
               •   initializes the environment variables HOME, SHELL, USER,
                   LOGNAME, and PATH
               •   changes to the target user’s home directory
               •   sets argv[0] of the shell to '-' in order to make the
                   shell a login shell
           -m, -p, --preserve-environment
               Preserve the entire environment, i.e., do not set HOME,
               SHELL, USER or LOGNAME. This option is ignored if the option
               --login is specified.
           -P, --pty
               Create a pseudo-terminal for the session. The independent
               terminal provides better security as the user does not share
               a terminal with the original session. This can be used to
               avoid TIOCSTI ioctl terminal injection and other security
               attacks against terminal file descriptors. The entire session
               can also be moved to the background (e.g., su --pty -
               username -c application &). If the pseudo-terminal is
               enabled, then su works as a proxy between the sessions (sync
               stdin and stdout).
               This feature is mostly designed for interactive sessions. If
               the standard input is not a terminal, but for example a pipe
               (e.g., echo "date" | su --pty), then the ECHO flag for the
               pseudo-terminal is disabled to avoid messy output.
           -s, --shell=shell
               Run the specified shell instead of the default. The shell to
               run is selected according to the following rules, in order:
               •   the shell specified with --shell
               •   the shell specified in the environment variable SHELL, if
                   the --preserve-environment option is used
               •   the shell listed in the passwd entry of the target user
               •   /bin/sh
           If the target user has a restricted shell (i.e., not listed in
           /etc/shells), the --shell option and the SHELL environment
           variables are ignored unless the calling user is root.
           --session-command=command
               Same as -c, but do not create a new session. (Discouraged.)
           -w, --whitelist-environment=list
               Don’t reset the environment variables specified in the
               comma-separated list when clearing the environment for
               --login. The whitelist is ignored for the environment
               variables HOME, SHELL, USER, LOGNAME, and PATH.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## SIGNALS         top
           Upon receiving either SIGINT, SIGQUIT or SIGTERM, su terminates
           its child and afterwards terminates itself with the received
           signal. The child is terminated by SIGTERM, after unsuccessful
           attempt and 2 seconds of delay the child is killed by SIGKILL.
## CONFIG FILES         top
           su reads the /etc/default/su and /etc/login.defs configuration
           files. The following configuration items are relevant for su:
           FAIL_DELAY (number)
               Delay in seconds in case of an authentication failure. The
               number must be a non-negative integer.
           ENV_PATH (string)
               Defines the PATH environment variable for a regular user. The
               default value is /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin.
           ENV_ROOTPATH (string), ENV_SUPATH (string)
               Defines the PATH environment variable for root. ENV_SUPATH
               takes precedence. The default value is
               /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin.
           ALWAYS_SET_PATH (boolean)
               If set to yes and --login and --preserve-environment were not
               specified su initializes PATH.
               The environment variable PATH may be different on systems
               where /bin and /sbin are merged into /usr; this variable is
               also affected by the --login command-line option and the PAM
               system setting (e.g., pam_env(8)).
## EXIT STATUS         top
           su normally returns the exit status of the command it executed.
           If the command was killed by a signal, su returns the number of
           the signal plus 128.
           Exit status generated by su itself:
           1
               Generic error before executing the requested command
           126
               The requested command could not be executed
           127
               The requested command was not found
## FILES         top
           /etc/pam.d/su
               default PAM configuration file
           /etc/pam.d/su-l
               PAM configuration file if --login is specified
           /etc/default/su
               command specific logindef config file
           /etc/login.defs
               global logindef config file
## NOTES         top
           For security reasons, su always logs failed log-in attempts to
           the btmp file, but it does not write to the lastlog file at all.
           This solution can be used to control su behavior by PAM
           configuration. If you want to use the pam_lastlog(8) module to
           print warning message about failed log-in attempts then
           pam_lastlog(8) has to be configured to update the lastlog file as
           well. For example by:
              session required pam_lastlog.so nowtmp
## HISTORY         top
           This su command was derived from coreutils' su, which was based
           on an implementation by David MacKenzie. The util-linux version
           has been refactored by Karel Zak.
