## NAME         top
           pmchart - strip chart tool for Performance Co-Pilot
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmchart [-CLVWz?]  [-a archive] [-A align] [--archive-folio
           folio] [-c configfile] [-f fontfamily] [-F fontsize] [-g
           geometry] [-h host] [-n pmnsfile] [-o outfile] [-O offset] [-p
           port] [-s samples] [-S starttime] [-t interval] [-T endtime] [-v

## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmchart is a graphical utility that plots performance metrics
           values available through the facilities of the Performance Co-
           Pilot (PCP).  Multiple charts can be displayed simultaneously,
           either aligned on the unified time axis (X-axis), and through the
           use of multiple interface Tabs.
           Metric values can be sourced from one or more live hosts
           (simultaneously).  Alternatively, one or more sets of PCP
           archives can be used as a source of historical data.  See
           PCPIntro(1) for an in-depth discussion of the capabilities of the
           PCP framework, many of which are used by pmchart.
           Many aspects of the behaviour of pmchart can be customised
           through the interface.  In particular, the use of "views" (refer
           to the section describing VIEWS later in this document) allows
           predefined sets of metrics and charting parameters like colors,
           scaling, titles, legends, and so on to be stored for later use,
           or use with different hosts and sets of archives.  In addition,
           the Preferences dialog allows customisations to the rest of the
           pmchart user interface to be saved and restored between different
           invocations of the tool.  This allows the default background
           color, highlight color, contents and location of the toolbar, and
           many other aspects to be configured.
           pmchart makes extensive use of the pmtime(1) utility for time
           control, refer to the pmtime manual page for further details of
           its operation.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a archive, --archive=archive
                Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
                Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive logs identified by this
                option, by default.  The argument is a comma-separated list
                of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive
                or the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
                The resulting set of archives will be the source of the
                performance metrics.  The initial Tab created will be an
                archive mode Tab.  Multiple -a options can be presented, and
                the resulting list of sets of archives is used for sourcing
                metric values.  Any sources listed on the command line are
                assumed to be sets of archives if this option is used.
           -A align, --align=align
                Force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a
                natural time unit align.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
                complete description of the syntax for align.
           --archive-folio=folio
                Read metric source archives from the PCP archive folio.
           -c configfile, --view=configfile
                configfile specifies an initial view to load, using the
                default source of metrics.  Multiple -c views can be
                specified, and they will all be opened in the default Tab
                with the default source of metrics.
           -c, --check
                Used with -c, the view(s) are parsed, any errors are
                reported, and the tool exits.  This is primarily intended
                for testing purposes.  If a second -C option is presented,
                pmchart also connects to pmcd(1) to check the semantics of
                metrics.
           -f family, --font-family=family
                Specify the default font family to be used in several chart
                components, such as the chart title, legend, and Y-axis
                label.  The default value is "Sans Serif".  This setting
                does not affect the rest of the user interface, where the
                value is inherited from the environment in which pmchart
                operates, and differs according to the look-and-feel of each
                platform.
           -F point, --font-size=point
                Specify the default font point size to be used in several
                chart components, such as the chart title, legend, and Y-
                axis label.  The default is platform dependent, but is
                either 7, 8 or 9.  This setting does not affect the rest of
                the user interface.
           -g geometry, --geometry=geometry
                Generate image with the specified geometry (width and
                height).  This option is only useful when used in
                conjunction with the -o option for generating an output
                image.  The geometry argument takes the form "WxH" (e.g.
                240x120).  When NOT using the -o flag, to specify the
                display window geometry, use -geometry geometry where
                geometry specifies the desired window width, height and
                optional placement.
           -h host, --host=host
                Current performance metric values are retrieved from the
                nominated host machine by default.  Multiple -h options can
                be presented, and the list of hosts is used for sourcing
                metric values.  Any sources listed on the command line are
                assumed to be hosts if this option is used.
           -H path, --hostsfile=path
                Specify the path to a file containing a set of hostnames
                where pmcd(1) is running , rather than using the default
                localhost.
           -K spec, --spec-local=spec
                When fetching metrics from a local context (see -L), the -K
                option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
                made accessible.  The spec argument conforms to the syntax
                described in pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).  More than one -K option
                may be used.
           -L, --local-PMDA
                Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the
                local host without PMCD.  See also -K.
           -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
                Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5))
                from the file pmnsfile.
           -o outfile, --output=outfile
                Generate an image file named outfile, and then exit.  This
                is most useful when run with a set of archives and one or
                more views.  The generated image will be in the format
                specified as the file extension (automatically determined
                from outfile).  If no extension can be determined, then the
                GIF format is used and the generated file is named with this
                extension.  The supported image file formats include: bmp,
                jpeg, jpg, png, ppm, tif, tiff, xbm, and xpm.
           -O origin, --origin=origin
                When reporting archived metrics, start reporting at origin
                within the time window (see -S and -T).  Refer to
                PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the syntax for
                origin.
           -p port, --guiport=port
                port number for connection to an existing pmtime time
                control process.
           -s samples, --samples=samples
                Specifies the number of samples that will be retained before
                discarding old data (replaced by new values at the current
                time position).  This value can subsequently be modified
                through the Edit Tab dialog.
           -S starttime, --start=starttime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged at or after starttime.
                Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
                syntax for starttime.
           -t interval, --interval=interval
                Sets the inital update interval to something other than the
                default 1 second.  The interval argument follows the syntax
                described in PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest form may be an
                unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are
                seconds).
           -T endtime, --finish=endtime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged before or at endtime.
                Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
                syntax for endtime.
           -v samples, --visible=samples
                Sets the initial visible samples that will be displayed in
                all charts in the default Tab.  This value must be less than
                or equal to the total number of samples retained (the -s
                value).
           -V, --version
                Display pmchart version number and exit
           -W, fB--white
                Export images using an opaque(white) background
           -z, --hostzone
                Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
                host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
                identified via either the -h or -a options.
           -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
                By default, pmtime reports the time of day according to the
                local timezone on the system where pmchart is run.  The -Z
                option changes the timezone to timezone in the format of the
                environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## VIEWS         top
           The primary pmchart configuration file is the "view", which
           allows the metadata associated with one or more charts to be
           saved in the filesystem.  This metadata describes all aspects of
           the charts, including which PCP metrics and instances are to be
           used, which hosts, which colors, the chart titles, use of chart
           legends, and much more.
           From a conceptual point of view, there are two classes of view.
           These views share the same configuration file format - refer to a
           later section for a complete description of this format.  The
           differences lie in where they are installed and how they are
           manipulated.
           The first class, the "system" view, is simply any view that is
           installed as part of the pmchart package.  These are stored in
           $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmchart.  When the File→Open View dialog is
           displayed, it is these views that are initially listed.  The
           system views cannot be modified by a normal user, and should not
           be modified even by a user with suitable privileges, as they will
           be overwritten during an upgrade.
           The second class of view is the "user" view.  These views are
           created on-the-fly using the File→Save View dialog.  This is a
           mechanism for individual users to save their commonly used views.
           Access to these views is achieved through the File→Open View
           dialog, as with the system views.  Once the dialog is opened, the
           list of views can be toggled between user and system views by
           clicking on the two toggle buttons in the top right corner.  User
           views are stored in $HOME/.pcp/pmchart.
## TABS         top
           pmchart provides the common user interface concept of the Tab,
           which is most prevalent in modern web browsers.  Tabs allow
           pmchart to update many more charts than the available screen real
           estate allows, by providing a user interface mechanism to stack
           (and switch between) different vertical sets of charts.
           Switching between Tabs is achieved by clicking on the Tab labels,
           which are located along the top of the display beneath the Menu
           and Tool bars).
           Each Tab has a mode of operation (either live or archive -
           pmchart can support both modes simultaneously), the total number
           of samples and currently visible points, and a label describing
           the Tab which is displayed at the top of the pmchart window.  New
           Tabs can be created using the File→Add Tab dialog.
           In order to save on vertical screen real estate, note that the
           user interface element for changing between different Tabs (and
           its label) are only displayed when more than one Tab exists.  A
           Tab can be dismissed using the File→Close Tab menu, which removes
           the current Tab and any charts it contained.
## IMAGES and PRINTING         top
           A static copy of the currently displayed vertical series of
           charts can be captured in two ways.
           When the intended display device is the screen, the File→Export
           menu option should be used.  This allows exporting the charts in
           a variety of image formats, including PNG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP.
           The image size can be scaled up or down in any dimension.
           Alternatively, when the intended display device is paper, the
           File→Print menu option can be used.  This supports the usual set
           of printing options (choice of printer, grayscale/color,
           landscape/portrait, scaling to different paper sizes, etc), and
           in addition allows printing to the intermediate printer formats
           of PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF).
## RECORDING         top
           It is possible to make a recording of a set of displayed charts,
           for later playback through pmchart or any of the other
           Performance Co-Pilot tools.  The Record→Start functionality is
           simple to configure through the user interface, and allows fine-
           tuning of the recording process (including record frequencies
           that differ to the pmchart update interval, alternate file
           locations, etc).
           pmchart produces recordings that are compatible with the PCP
           pmafm(1) replay mechanism, for later playback via a new instance
           of pmchart.  In addition, when recording through pmchart one can
           also replay the recording immediately, as on termination of the
           recording (through the Record→Stop menu item), an archive mode
           Tab will be created with the captured view.
           Once recording is active in a Live Tab, the Time Control status
           button in the bottom left corner of the pmchart window is
           displayed with a distinctive red dot.  At any time during a
           pmchart recording session, the amount of space used in the
           filesystem by that recording can be displayed using the
           Record→Query menu item.
           Finally, the Record→Detach menu option provides a mechanism
           whereby the recording process can be completely divorced from the
           running pmchart process, and allowed to continue on when pmchart
           exits.  A dialog displaying the current size and estimated rate
           of growth for the recording is presented.  On the other hand, if
           pmchart is terminated while recording is in process, then the
           recording process will prompt the user to choose immediate
           cessation of recording or for it to continue on independently.
           All of the record mode services available from pmchart are
           implemented with the assistance of the base Performance Co-Pilot
           logging services - refer to pmlogger(1) and pmafm(1) for an
           extensive description of the capabilities of these tools.
## CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX         top
           pmchart loads predefined chart configurations (or "views") from
           external files that conform to the following rules.  In the
           descriptions below keywords (shown in bold) may appear in upper,
           lower or mixed case, elements shown in [stuff] are optional, and
           user-supplied elements are shown as <other stuff>.  A vertical
           bar (|) is used where syntactic elements are alternatives.
           Quotes (") may be used to enclose lexical elements that may
           contain white space, such as titles, labels and instance names.
           1. The first line defines the configuration file type and should
              be
                   #kmchart
              although pmchart provides backwards compatibility for the
              older pmchart view formats with an initial line of
                   #pmchart
           2. After the first line, lines beginning with "#" as the first
              non-white space character are treated as comments and skipped.
              Similarly blank lines are skipped.
           3. The next line should be
                   version <n> <host-clause>
              where <n> depends on the configuration file type, and is 1 for
              pmchart else 1.1, 1.2 or 2.0 for pmchart.
              The <host-clause> part is optional (and ignored) for pmchart
              configuration files, but required for the pmchart
              configuration files, and is of the form
                   host literal
              or
                   host dynamic
           4. A configuration contains one or more charts defined as
              follows:
                   chart [title <title>] style <style> <options>
              If specified, the title will appear centred and above the
              graph area of the chart.  The <title> is usually enclosed in
              quotes (") and if it contains the sequence "%h" this will be
              replaced by the short form of the hostname for the default
              source of metrics at the time this chart was loaded.
              Alternatively, "%H" can be used to insert the full host name.
              If the hostname appears to be an inet or IPv6 address, no
              shortening will be attempted; it will be used as-is in both
              replacement cases.  After the view is loaded, the title
              visibility and setting can be manipulated using the Chart
              Title text box in the Edit→Chart dialog.
              The <style> controls the initial plotting style of the chart,
              and should be one of the keywords plot (line graph), bar,
              stacking (stacked bar), area or utilization.  After the view
              is loaded, the plotting style can be changed using the
              Edit→Chart Style dropdown list.
              The <options> are zero or more of the optional elements:
                   [scale [from] <ymin> [to] <ymax>] [legend <onoff>]
              If scale is specified, the vertical scaling is set for all
              plots in the chart to a y-range defined by <ymin> and <ymax>.
              Otherwise the vertical axis will be autoscaled based on the
              values currently being plotted.
              <onoff> is one of the keywords on or off and the legend clause
              controls the presence or absence of the plot legend below the
              graph area.  The default is for the legend to be shown.  After
              the view is loaded, the legend visibility can be toggled using
              the Show Legend button in the Edit→Chart dialog.
           5. pmchart supports a global clause to specify the dimensions of
              the top-level window (using the width and height keywords),
              the number of visible points (points keyword) and the starting
              X and Y axis positions on the screen (xpos and ypos keywords).
              Each of these global attributes takes an integer value as the
              sole qualifier.
           6. Each chart has one or more plots associated with it, as
              defined by one of the following specifications:
                   plot
                       [legend <title>] [color <colorspec>] [host <hostspec>]
                       metric <metricname>
                       [ instance <inst> | matching <pat> | not-matching <pat> ]
              The keyword plot may be replaced with the keyword optional-
              plot, in which case if the source of performance data does not
              include the specified performance metric and/or instance, then
              this plot is silently dropped from the chart.
              If specified, the title will appear in the chart legend.  The
              <title> is usually enclosed in quotes (") and it may contain
              one or more wildcard characters which will be expanded using
              metric name, instance name, and host name for the plot.  The
              wildcards are "%i" (short unique instance name, up to the
              first whitespace), "%I" (full instance name), "%h" (short host
              name, up to the first dot), %H (full host name), "%m" (metric
              name shortened to the final two PMNS components), and "%M"
              (full metric name).
              For older pmchart configuration files, the keyword title must
              be used instead of legend.  Nowadays pmchart supports either
              keyword.
              The color clause is optional for newer pmchart configuration
              files, but it was mandatory in the original pmchart
              configuration file format.  <colorspec> may be one of the
              following:
                   #-cycle
                   rgbi:rr:gg:bb
                   #rgb
                   #rrggbb
                   #rrrgggbbb
                   #rrrrggggbbbb
                   <Xcolor>
              where each of r, g and b are hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F)
              representing respectively the red, green and blue color
              components.  <Xcolor> is one of the color names from the X
              color database, e.g. red or steelblue, see also the output
              from showrgb(1).
              The "color" #-cycle specifies that pmchart should use the next
              in a pallet of colors that it uses cyclically for each chart.
              This is the default if the color clause is omitted.
              The <hostspec> in the host clause may be a hostname, an IP
              address or an asterisk (*); the latter is used to mean the
              default source of performance metrics.  For older pmchart
              configuration files, the host clause must be present, for new
              pmchart configuration files it is optional, and if missing the
              default source of performance metrics will be used.
              The optional instance specification,
              (a)
                 is omitted in which case one plot will be created for every
                 instance of the <metricname> metric
              (b)
                 starts with instance, in which case only the instance named
                 <inst> will be plotted
              (c)
                 starts with matching, in which case all instances whose
                 names match the pattern <pat> will be plotted; the pattern
                 uses extended regular expression notation in the style of
                 egrep(1) (refer to the PMCD view for an example)
              (d)
                 starts with not-matching, in which case all instances whose
                 names do   not match the pattern <pat> will be plotted; the
                 pattern uses extended regular expression notation in the
                 style of egrep(1) (refer to the Netbytes view for an
                 example)
              pmchart uses a bizarre syntactic notation where <inst> and
              <pat> extend from the first non-white space character to the
              end of the input line.  For pmchart configuration files these
              elements are either delimited by white space, or enclosed in
              quotes (").
           7. The optional tab directive can be used to create views with
              multiple charts which span multiple Tabs.  The syntax is as
              follows:
                   tab <label> [host <host>] [points <points> [samples <samples>]]
              All chart specifications following this keyword will be created
              on the new Tab, until the end of the configuration file or until
              another tab keyword is encountered.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           Of particular note, the $PCP_XCONFIRM_PROG setting is explicitly
           and unconditionally overridden by pmchart.  This is set to the
           pmconfirm(1), utility, in order that some popup dialogs
           (particularly in the area of Recording) maintain a consistent
           look-and-feel with the rest of the pmchart application.
