## NAME         top
           systemd-escape - Escape strings for usage in systemd unit names
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-escape [OPTIONS...] [STRING...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           systemd-escape may be used to escape strings for inclusion in
           systemd unit names. The command may be used to escape and to undo
           escaping of strings.
           The command takes any number of strings on the command line, and
           will process them individually, one after another. It will output
           them separated by spaces to stdout.
           By default, this command will escape the strings passed, unless
           --unescape is passed which results in the inverse operation being
           applied. If --mangle is given, a special mode of escaping is
           applied instead, which assumes the string is already escaped but
           will escape everything that appears obviously non-escaped.
           For details on the escaping and unescaping algorithms see the
           relevant section in systemd.unit(5).
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           --suffix=
               Appends the specified unit type suffix to the escaped string.
               Takes one of the unit types supported by systemd, such as
               "service" or "mount". May not be used in conjunction with
               --template=, --unescape or --mangle.
           --template=
               Inserts the escaped strings in a unit name template. Takes a
               unit name template such as foobar@.service. With --unescape,
               expects instantiated unit names for this template and
               extracts and unescapes just the instance part. May not be
               used in conjunction with --suffix=, --instance or --mangle.
           --path, -p
               When escaping or unescaping a string, assume it refers to a
               file system path. This eliminates leading, trailing or
               duplicate "/" characters and rejects "."  and ".."  path
               components. This is particularly useful for generating
               strings suitable for unescaping with the "%f" specifier in
               unit files, see systemd.unit(5).
           --unescape, -u
               Instead of escaping the specified strings, undo the escaping,
               reversing the operation. May not be used in conjunction with
               --suffix= or --mangle.
           --mangle, -m
               Like --escape, but only escape characters that are obviously
               not escaped yet, and possibly automatically append an
               appropriate unit type suffix to the string. May not be used
               in conjunction with --suffix=, --template= or --unescape.
           --instance
               With --unescape, unescape and print only the instance part of
               an instantiated unit name template. Results in an error for
               an uninstantiated template like ssh@.service or a
               non-template name like ssh.service. Must be used in
               conjunction with --unescape and may not be used in
               conjunction with --template.
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
## EXAMPLES         top
           To escape a single string:
               $ systemd-escape 'Hallöchen, Meister'
               Hall\xc3\xb6chen\x2c\x20Meister
           To undo escaping on a single string:
               $ systemd-escape -u 'Hall\xc3\xb6chen\x2c\x20Meister'
               Hallöchen, Meister
           To generate the mount unit for a path:
               $ systemd-escape -p --suffix=mount "/tmp//waldi/foobar/"
               tmp-waldi-foobar.mount
           To generate instance names of three strings:
               $ systemd-escape --template=systemd-nspawn@.service 'My Container 1' 'containerb' 'container/III'
               systemd-nspawn@My\x20Container\x201.service systemd-nspawn@containerb.service systemd-nspawn@container-III.service
           To extract the instance part of an instantiated unit:
               $ systemd-escape -u --instance 'systemd-nspawn@My\x20Container\x201.service'
               My Container 1
           To extract the instance part of an instance of a particular
           template:
               $ systemd-escape -u --template=systemd-nspawn@.service 'systemd-nspawn@My\x20Container\x201.service'
               My Container 1
## EXIT STATUS         top
           On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
