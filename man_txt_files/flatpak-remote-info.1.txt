    FLATPAK REMOTE-INFO(1)     flatpak remote-info    FLATPAK REMOTE-INFO(1)
## NAME         top
           flatpak-remote-info - Show information about an application or
           runtime in a remote
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak remote-info [OPTION...] REMOTE REF
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Shows information about the runtime or application REF from the
           remote repository with the name REMOTE. You can find all
           configured remote repositories with flatpak remotes.
           By default, the output is formatted in a friendly format. If you
           specify one of the --show-...  options, the output is instead
           formatted in a machine-readable format.
           Unless overridden with the --system, --user, or --installation
           options, this command uses either the default system-wide
           installation or the per-user one, depending on which has the
           specified REMOTE.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -u, --user
               Use the per-user configuration.
           --system
               Use the default system-wide configuration.
           --installation=NAME
               Use a system-wide installation specified by NAME among those
               defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --cached
               Prefer to use locally cached information if possible, even
               though it may be out of date. This is faster, but risks
               returning stale information. Also, some information is not
               cached so will not be available.
           --runtime
               Assume that REF is a runtime if not explicitly specified.
           --app
               Assume that REF is an app if not explicitly specified.
           --arch=ARCH
               The default architecture to look for, if not given explicitly
               in the REF. See flatpak --supported-arches for architectures
               supported by the host.
           --commit=COMMIT
               Show information about the specific commit, rather than the
               latest version.
           --log
               Display a log of previous versions.
           -r, --show-ref
               Show the matched ref.
           -c, --show-commit
               Show the commit id.
           -p, --show-parent
               Show the parent commit id.
           -m, --show-metadata
               Show the metadata.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
