    COMM(1)                       User Commands                      COMM(1)
## NAME         top
           comm - compare two sorted files line by line
## SYNOPSIS         top
           comm [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Compare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line.
           When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input.
           With no options, produce three-column output.  Column one
           contains lines unique to FILE1, column two contains lines unique
           to FILE2, and column three contains lines common to both files.
           -1     suppress column 1 (lines unique to FILE1)
           -2     suppress column 2 (lines unique to FILE2)
           -3     suppress column 3 (lines that appear in both files)
           --check-order
                  check that the input is correctly sorted, even if all
                  input lines are pairable
           --nocheck-order
                  do not check that the input is correctly sorted
           --output-delimiter=STR
                  separate columns with STR
           --total
                  output a summary
           -z, --zero-terminated
                  line delimiter is NUL, not newline
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           Note, comparisons honor the rules specified by 'LC_COLLATE'.
## EXAMPLES         top
           comm -12 file1 file2
                  Print only lines present in both file1 and file2.
           comm -3 file1 file2
                  Print lines in file1 not in file2, and vice versa.
