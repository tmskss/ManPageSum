## NAME         top
           pmdanfsclient - NFS client statistics performance metrics domain
           agent (PMDA)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdanfsclient is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values from the /proc/self/mountstats interface to
           provide information on NFS mounts.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install the nfsclient PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nfsclient
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nfsclient
               # ./Remove
           pmdanfsclient is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nfsclient/Install
               installation script for the pmdanfsclient agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nfsclient/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdanfsclient agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/nfsclient.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdanfsclient
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
