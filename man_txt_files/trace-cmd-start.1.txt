## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-start - start the Ftrace Linux kernel tracer without
           recording
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd start [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) start enables all the Ftrace tracing the same
           way trace-cmd-record(1) does. The difference is that it does not
           run threads to create a trace.dat file. This is useful just to
           enable Ftrace and you are only interested in the trace after some
           event has occurred and the trace is stopped. Then the trace can
           be read straight from the Ftrace pseudo file system or can be
           extracted with trace-cmd-extract(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           The options are the same as trace-cmd-record(1), except that it
           does not take options specific to recording (-s, -o, -N, and -t).
           --fork
               This option is only available for trace-cmd start. It tells
               trace-cmd to not wait for the process to finish before
               returning. With this option, trace-cmd start will return
               right after it forks the process on the command line. This
               option only has an effect if trace-cmd start also executes a
               command.
