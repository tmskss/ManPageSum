## NAME         top
           git-mergetool--lib - Common Git merge tool shell scriptlets
## SYNOPSIS         top
           TOOL_MODE=(diff|merge) . "$(git --exec-path)/git-mergetool--lib"
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
           documentation is meant for people who are studying the
           Porcelain-ish scripts and/or are writing new ones.
           The git-mergetool--lib scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using
           .) by other shell scripts to set up functions for working with
           Git merge tools.
           Before sourcing git-mergetool--lib, your script must set
           TOOL_MODE to define the operation mode for the functions listed
           below. diff and merge are valid values.
## FUNCTIONS         top
           get_merge_tool
               returns a merge tool. the return code is 1 if we returned a
               guessed merge tool, else 0.  $GIT_MERGETOOL_GUI may be set to
               true to search for the appropriate guitool.
           get_merge_tool_cmd
               returns the custom command for a merge tool.
           get_merge_tool_path
               returns the custom path for a merge tool.
           initialize_merge_tool
               bring merge tool specific functions into scope so they can be
               used or overridden.
           run_merge_tool
               launches a merge tool given the tool name and a true/false
               flag to indicate whether a merge base is present.  $MERGED,
               $LOCAL, $REMOTE, and $BASE must be defined for use by the
               merge tool.
