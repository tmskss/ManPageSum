## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           touch — change file access and modification times
## SYNOPSIS         top
           touch [-acm] [-r ref_file|-t time|-d date_time] file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The touch utility shall change the last data modification
           timestamps, the last data access timestamps, or both.
           The time used can be specified by the -t time option-argument,
           the corresponding time fields of the file referenced by the -r
           ref_file option-argument, or the -d date_time option-argument, as
           specified in the following sections. If none of these are
           specified, touch shall use the current time.
           For each file operand, touch shall perform actions equivalent to
           the following functions defined in the System Interfaces volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017:
            1. If file does not exist:
                a. The creat() function is called with the following
                   arguments:
                   --  The file operand is used as the path argument.
                   --  The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRUSR,
                       S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH is
                       used as the mode argument.
                b. The futimens() function is called with the following
                   arguments:
                   --  The file descriptor opened in step 1a.
                   --  The access time and the modification time, set as
                       described in the OPTIONS section, are used as the
                       first and second elements of the times array
                       argument, respectively.
            2. If file exists, the utimensat() function is called with the
               following arguments:
                a. The AT_FDCWD special value is used as the fd argument.
                b. The file operand is used as the path argument.
                c. The access time and the modification time, set as
                   described in the OPTIONS section, are used as the first
                   and second elements of the times array argument,
                   respectively.
                d. The flag argument is set to zero.
## OPTIONS         top
           The touch utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -a        Change the access time of file.  Do not change the
                     modification time unless -m is also specified.
           -c        Do not create a specified file if it does not exist. Do
                     not write any diagnostic messages concerning this
                     condition.
           -d date_time
                     Use the specified date_time instead of the current
                     time. The option-argument shall be a string of the
                     form:
                         YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:SS[.frac][tz]
                     or:
                         YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:SS[,frac][tz]
                     where:
                      *  YYYY are at least four decimal digits giving the
                         year.
                      *  MM, DD, hh, mm, and SS are as with -t time.
                      *  T is the time designator, and can be replaced by a
                         single <space>.
                      *  [.frac] and [,frac] are either empty, or a <period>
                         ('.')  or a <comma> (',') respectively, followed by
                         one or more decimal digits, specifying a fractional
                         second.
                      *  [tz] is either empty, signifying local time, or the
                         letter 'Z', signifying UTC. If [tz] is empty, the
                         resulting time shall be affected by the value of
                         the TZ environment variable.
                     If the resulting time precedes the Epoch, the behavior
                     is implementation-defined. If the time cannot be
                     represented as the file's timestamp, touch shall exit
                     immediately with an error status.
           -m        Change the modification time of file.  Do not change
                     the access time unless -a is also specified.
           -r ref_file
                     Use the corresponding time of the file named by the
                     pathname ref_file instead of the current time.
           -t time   Use the specified time instead of the current time. The
                     option-argument shall be a decimal number of the form:
                         [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]
                     where each two digits represents the following:
                     MM      The month of the year [01,12].
                     DD      The day of the month [01,31].
                     hh      The hour of the day [00,23].
                     mm      The minute of the hour [00,59].
                     CC      The first two digits of the year (the century).
                     YY      The second two digits of the year.
                     SS      The second of the minute [00,60].
                     Both CC and YY shall be optional. If neither is given,
                     the current year shall be assumed. If YY is specified,
                     but CC is not, CC shall be derived as follows:
                                    ┌──────────┬─────────────┐
                                    │If YY is: │ CC becomes: │
                                    ├──────────┼─────────────┤
                                    │ [69,99]  │     19      │
                                    │ [00,68]  │     20      │
                                    └──────────┴─────────────┘
                     Note:  It is expected that in a future version of this
                            standard the default century inferred from a
                            2-digit year will change. (This would apply to
                            all commands accepting a 2-digit year as input.)
                     The resulting time shall be affected by the value of
                     the TZ environment variable. If the resulting time
                     value precedes the Epoch, the behavior is
                     implementation-defined. If the time is out of range for
                     the file's timestamp, touch shall exit immediately with
                     an error status. The range of valid times past the
                     Epoch is implementation-defined, but it shall extend to
                     at least the time 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds,
                     January 1, 2038, Coordinated Universal Time. Some
                     implementations may not be able to represent dates
                     beyond January 18, 2038, because they use signed int as
                     a time holder.
                     The range for SS is [00,60] rather than [00,59] because
                     of leap seconds. If SS is 60, and the resulting time,
                     as affected by the TZ environment variable, does not
                     refer to a leap second, the resulting time shall be one
                     second after a time where SS is 59. If SS is not given
                     a value, it is assumed to be zero.
           If neither the -a nor -m options were specified, touch shall
           behave as if both the -a and -m options were specified.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of a file whose times shall be modified.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           touch:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
           TZ        Determine the timezone to be used for interpreting the
                     time option-argument. If TZ is unset or null, an
                     unspecified default timezone shall be used.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    The utility executed successfully and all requested changes
                 were made.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           The interpretation of time is taken to be seconds since the Epoch
           (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 4.16,
           Seconds Since the Epoch).  It should be noted that
           implementations conforming to the System Interfaces volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017 do not take leap seconds into account when computing
           seconds since the Epoch. When SS=60 is used, the resulting time
           always refers to 1 plus seconds since the Epoch for a time when
           SS=59.
           Although the -t time option-argument specifies values in 1969,
           the access time and modification time fields are defined in terms
           of seconds since the Epoch (00:00:00 on 1 January 1970 UTC).
           Therefore, depending on the value of TZ when touch is run, there
           is never more than a few valid hours in 1969 and there need not
           be any valid times in 1969.
           If the T time designator is replaced by a <space> for the -d
           date_time option-argument, the <space> must be quoted to prevent
           the shell from splitting the argument.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Create or update a file called dwc; the resulting file has both
           the last data modification and last data access timestamps set to
           November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 local time:
               touch -d 2007-11-12T10:15:30 dwc
           Create or update a file called nick; the resulting file has both
           the last data modification and last data access timestamps set to
           November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 UTC:
               touch -d 2007-11-12T10:15:30Z nick
           Create or update a file called gwc; the resulting file has both
           the last data modification and last data access timestamps set to
           November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 local time with a fractional second
           timestamp of .002 seconds:
               touch -d 2007-11-12T10:15:30,002 gwc
           Create or update a file called ajosey; the resulting file has
           both the last data modification and last data access timestamps
           set to November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 UTC with a fractional second
           timestamp of .002 seconds:
               touch -d "2007-11-12 10:15:30.002Z" ajosey
           Create or update a file called cathy; the resulting file has both
           the last data modification and last data access timestamps set to
           November 12, 2007 at 10:15:00 local time:
               touch -t 200711121015 cathy
           Create or update a file called drepper; the resulting file has
           both the last data modification and last data access timestamps
           set to November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 local time:
               touch -t 200711121015.30 drepper
           Create or update a file called ebb9; the resulting file has both
           the last data modification and last data access timestamps set to
           November 12, 2007 at 10:15:30 local time:
               touch -t 0711121015.30 ebb9
           Create or update a file called eggert; the resulting file has the
           last data access timestamp set to the corresponding time of the
           file named mark instead of the current time. If the file exists,
           the last data modification time is not changed:
               touch -a -r mark eggert
## RATIONALE         top
           The functionality of touch is described almost entirely through
           references to functions in the System Interfaces volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017. In this way, there is no duplication of effort
           required for describing such side-effects as the relationship of
           user IDs to the user database, permissions, and so on.
           There are some significant differences between the touch utility
           in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 and those in System V and BSD
           systems. They are upwards-compatible for historical applications
           from both implementations:
            1. In System V, an ambiguity exists when a pathname that is a
               decimal number leads the operands; it is treated as a time
               value. In BSD, no time value is allowed; files may only be
               touched to the current time. The -t time construct solves
               these problems for future conforming applications (note that
               the -t option is not historical practice).
            2. The inclusion of the century digits, CC, is also new. Note
               that a ten-digit time value is treated as if YY, and not CC,
               were specified. The caveat about the range of dates following
               the Epoch was included as recognition that some
               implementations are not able to represent dates beyond 18
               January 2038 because they use signed int as a time holder.
           The -r option was added because several comments requested this
           capability.  This option was named -f in an early proposal, but
           was changed because the -f option is used in the BSD version of
           touch with a different meaning.
           At least one historical implementation of touch incremented the
           exit code if -c was specified and the file did not exist. This
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires exit status zero if no errors
           occur.
           In previous version of the standard, if at least two operands are
           specified, and the first operand is an eight or ten-digit decimal
           integer, the first operand was assumed to be a date_time operand.
           This usage was removed in this version of the standard since it
           had been marked obsolescent previously.
           The -d date_time format is an ISO 8601:2004 standard complete
           representation of date and time extended format with an optional
           decimal point or <comma> followed by a string of digits following
           the seconds portion to specify fractions of a second. It is not
           necessary to recognize "[+/-]hh:mm" and "[+/-]hh" to specify
           timezones other than local time and UTC. The T time designator in
           the ISO 8601:2004 standard extended format may be replaced by
           <space>.
