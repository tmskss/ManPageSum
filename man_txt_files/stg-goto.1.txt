## NAME         top
           stg-goto - Go to patch by pushing or popping as necessary
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg goto [OPTIONS] <patch>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Go to patch by pushing or popping as necessary
## OPTIONS         top
           -k, --keep
               Keep the local changes
           -m, --merged
               Check for patches merged upstream
           --committer-date-is-author-date
               Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
               the author date of the commit as the committer date.
           --conflicts[=<policy>]
               Either "allow" or "disallow" pushing a patch with conflicts.
               Using --conflicts=allow (or just --conflicts) allows pushing
               a patch that may result in unresolved merge conflicts. The
               patch will be pushed and files with conflicts will be left
               with conflict markers to be resolved manually; or the
               operation undone with stg undo --hard. This is the default
               behavior and also corresponds to the
               "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" variable being set to "true".
               Using --conflicts=disallow disallows pushing any patch that
               would result in merge conflicts. The operation will stop on
               the last patch that can be pushed without conflicts. This
               behavior can be configured by setting
               "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" to "false".

           this manual page, see ⟨http://www.procode.org/stgit/⟩.  This page
           was obtained from the project's upstream Git repository
