## NAME         top
           dh_installemacsen - register an Emacs add on package
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installemacsen [debhelper options] [-n] [--priority=n]
           [--flavor=foo]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installemacsen is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           installing files used by the Debian emacsen-common package into
           package build directories.
           It also automatically generates the preinst postinst and prerm
           commands needed to register a package as an Emacs add on package.
           The commands are added to the maintainer scripts by
           dh_installdeb. See dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of how
           this works.
## FILES         top
           debian/package.emacsen-compat
               Installed into usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/compat/package
               in the package build directory.
           debian/package.emacsen-install
               Installed into
               usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/install/package in the
               package build directory.
           debian/package.emacsen-remove
               Installed into usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/remove/package
               in the package build directory.
           debian/package.emacsen-startup
               Installed into etc/emacs/site-start.d/50package.el in the
               package build directory. Use --priority to use a different
               priority than 50.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --no-scripts
               Do not modify postinst/prerm scripts.
           --priority=n
               Sets the priority number of a site-start.d file. Default is
               50.
           --flavor=foo
               Sets the flavor a site-start.d file will be installed in.
               Default is emacs, alternatives include xemacs and emacs20.
## NOTES         top
           Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
           called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may
           cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
           maintainer scripts.
