## NAME         top
           deallocvt - deallocate unused virtual consoles
## SYNOPSIS         top
           deallocvt [option...]  [N ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The command deallocvt deallocates kernel memory and data
           structures for all unused virtual consoles.  If one or more
           arguments N ...  are given, only the corresponding consoles
           /dev/ttyN are deallocated.
           A virtual console is unused if it is not the foreground console,
           and no process has it open for reading or writing, and no text
           has been selected on its screen.
