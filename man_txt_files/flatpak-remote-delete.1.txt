           configuration.  NAME is the name of an existing remote.
           Unless overridden with the --system, --user, or --installation
           options, this command uses either the default system-wide
           installation or the per-user one, depending on which has the
           specified REMOTE.
## OPTIONS         top

               those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --force
