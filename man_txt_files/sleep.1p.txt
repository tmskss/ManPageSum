    SLEEP(1P)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              SLEEP(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           sleep — suspend execution for an interval
## SYNOPSIS         top
           sleep time
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The sleep utility shall suspend execution for at least the
           integral number of seconds specified by the time operand.
## OPTIONS         top
           None.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           time      A non-negative decimal integer specifying the number of
                     seconds for which to suspend execution.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           sleep:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           If the sleep utility receives a SIGALRM signal, one of the
           following actions shall be taken:
            1. Terminate normally with a zero exit status.
            2. Effectively ignore the signal.
            3. Provide the default behavior for signals described in the
               ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section of Section 1.4, Utility
               Description Defaults.  This could include terminating with a
               non-zero exit status.
           The sleep utility shall take the standard action for all other
           signals.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    The execution was successfully suspended for at least time
                 seconds, or a SIGALRM signal was received. See the
                 ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
           The sleep utility can be used to execute a command after a
           certain amount of time, as in:
               (sleep 105; command) &
           or to execute a command every so often, as in:
               while true
               do
                   command
                   sleep 37
               done
## RATIONALE         top
           The exit status is allowed to be zero when sleep is interrupted
           by the SIGALRM signal because most implementations of this
           utility rely on the arrival of that signal to notify them that
           the requested finishing time has been successfully attained. Such
           implementations thus do not distinguish this situation from the
           successful completion case. Other implementations are allowed to
           catch the signal and go back to sleep until the requested time
           expires or to provide the normal signal termination procedures.
           As with all other utilities that take integral operands and do
           not specify subranges of allowed values, sleep is required by
           this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to deal with time requests of up to
           2147483647 seconds. This may mean that some implementations have
           to make multiple calls to the delay mechanism of the underlying
           operating system if its argument range is less than this.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
