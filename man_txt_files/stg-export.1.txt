## NAME         top
           stg-export - Export patches to a directory
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg export [OPTIONS] [patch]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Export a range of patches to a given directory in unified diff
           format. All applied patches are exported by default.
           Patches are exported to patches-<branch> by default. The --dir
           option may be used to specify a different output directory.
           The patch file output may be customized via a template file found
           at "$GIT_DIR/patchexport.tmpl",
           "~/.stgit/templates/patchexport.tmpl", or
           "$(prefix)/share/stgit/templates". The following variables are
           supported in the template file:
               %(description)s - patch description
               %(shortdescr)s  - the first line of the patch description
               %(longdescr)s   - the rest of the patch description, after the first line
               %(diffstat)s    - the diff statistics
               %(authname)s    - author name
               %(authemail)s   - author email
               %(authdate)s    - patch creation date (ISO-8601 format)
               %(commname)s    - committer name
               %(commemail)s   - committer email

           -d <dir>, --dir=<dir>
               Export patches to <dir> instead of the default

           -t <file>, --template=<file>
               Use <file> as template

               Pass additional <option> to git diff.
               See the git-diff(1) man page. This option may be specified
               multiple times.
