## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-show - show the contents of the Ftrace Linux kernel
           tracing buffer.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd show [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) show displays the contents of one of the Ftrace
           Linux kernel tracing files: trace, snapshot, or trace_pipe. It is
           basically the equivalent of doing:
               cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace
## OPTIONS         top
           -p
               Instead of displaying the contents of the "trace" file, use
               the "trace_pipe" file. The difference between the two is that
               the "trace" file is static. That is, if tracing is stopped,
               the "trace" file will show the same contents each time.
                   The "trace_pipe" file is a consuming read, where a read of the file
                   will consume the output of what was read and it will not read the
                   same thing a second time even if tracing is stopped. This file
                   als will block. If no data is available, trace-cmd show will stop
                   and wait for data to appear.
           -s
               Instead of reading the "trace" file, read the snapshot file.
               The snapshot is made by an application writing into it and
               the kernel will perform as swap between the currently active
               buffer and the current snapshot buffer. If no more swaps are
               made, the snapshot will remain static. This is not a
               consuming read.
           -c cpu
               Read only the trace file for a specified CPU.
           -f
               Display the full path name of the file that is being
               displayed.
           -B buf
               If a buffer instance was created, then the -B option will
               access the files associated with the given buffer.
           --tracing_on
               Show if tracing is on for the given instance.
           --current_tracer
               Show what the current tracer is.
           --buffer_size
               Show the current buffer size (per-cpu)
           --buffer_total_size
               Show the total size of all buffers.
           --ftrace_filter
               Show what function filters are set.
           --ftrace_notrace
               Show what function disabled filters are set.
           --ftrace_pid
               Show the PIDs the function tracer is limited to (if any).
           --graph_function
               Show the functions that will be graphed.
           --graph_notrace
               Show the functions that will not be graphed.
           --cpumask
               Show the mask of CPUs that tracing will trace.
