## NAME         top
           git-pack-redundant - Find redundant pack files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git pack-redundant [--verbose] [--alt-odb] (--all | <pack-filename>...)
## WARNING         top
           git pack-redundant has been deprecated and is scheduled for
           removal in a future version of Git. Because it can only remove
           entire duplicate packs and not individual duplicate objects, it
           is generally not a useful tool for reducing repository size. You
           are better off using git gc to do so, which will put objects into
           a new pack, removing duplicates.
           Running pack-redundant without the --i-still-use-this flag will
           fail in this release. If you believe you have a use case for
           which pack-redundant is better suited and oppose this removal,
           please contact the Git mailing list at git@vger.kernel.org[1].
           More information about the list is available at
           https://git-scm.com/community .
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This program computes which packs in your repository are
           redundant. The output is suitable for piping to xargs rm if you
           are in the root of the repository.
           git pack-redundant accepts a list of objects on standard input.
           Any objects given will be ignored when checking which packs are
           required. This makes the following command useful when wanting to
           remove packs which contain unreachable objects.
           git fsck --full --unreachable | cut -d ' ' -f3 | \ git
           pack-redundant --all | xargs rm
## OPTIONS         top
           --all
               Processes all packs. Any filenames on the command line are
               ignored.
           --alt-odb
               Don’t require objects present in packs from alternate object
               database (odb) directories to be present in local packs.
           --verbose
               Outputs some statistics to stderr. Has a small performance
               penalty.
