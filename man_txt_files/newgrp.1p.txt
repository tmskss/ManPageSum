    NEWGRP(1P)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             NEWGRP(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           newgrp — change to a new group
## SYNOPSIS         top
           newgrp [-l] [group]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The newgrp utility shall create a new shell execution environment
           with a new real and effective group identification. Of the
           attributes listed in Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment,
           the new shell execution environment shall retain the working
           directory, file creation mask, and exported variables from the
           previous environment (that is, open files, traps, unexported
           variables, alias definitions, shell functions, and set options
           may be lost). All other aspects of the process environment that
           are preserved by the exec family of functions defined in the
           System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall also be preserved
           by newgrp; whether other aspects are preserved is unspecified.
           A failure to assign the new group identifications (for example,
           for security or password-related reasons) shall not prevent the
           new shell execution environment from being created.
           The newgrp utility shall affect the supplemental groups for the
           process as follows:
            *  On systems where the effective group ID is normally in the
               supplementary group list (or whenever the old effective group
               ID actually is in the supplementary group list):
               --  If the new effective group ID is also in the
                   supplementary group list, newgrp shall change the
                   effective group ID.
               --  If the new effective group ID is not in the supplementary
                   group list, newgrp shall add the new effective group ID
                   to the list, if there is room to add it.
            *  On systems where the effective group ID is not normally in
               the supplementary group list (or whenever the old effective
               group ID is not in the supplementary group list):
               --  If the new effective group ID is in the supplementary
                   group list, newgrp shall delete it.
               --  If the old effective group ID is not in the supplementary
                   list, newgrp shall add it if there is room.
           Note:
               The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify
               whether the effective group ID of a process is included in
               its supplementary group list.
           With no operands, newgrp shall change the effective group back to
           the groups identified in the user's user entry, and shall set the
           list of supplementary groups to that set in the user's group
           database entries.
           If the first argument is '-', the results are unspecified.
           If a password is required for the specified group, and the user
           is not listed as a member of that group in the group database,
           the user shall be prompted to enter the correct password for that
           group. If the user is listed as a member of that group, no
           password shall be requested.  If no password is required for the
           specified group, it is implementation-defined whether users not
           listed as members of that group can change to that group. Whether
           or not a password is required, implementation-defined system
           accounting or security mechanisms may impose additional
           authorization restrictions that may cause newgrp to write a
           diagnostic message and suppress the changing of the group
           identification.
## OPTIONS         top
           The newgrp utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
           for the unspecified usage of '-'.
           The following option shall be supported:
           -l        (The letter ell.) Change the environment to what would
                     be expected if the user actually logged in again.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           group     A group name from the group database or a non-negative
                     numeric group ID. Specifies the group ID to which the
                     real and effective group IDs shall be set. If group is
                     a non-negative numeric string and exists in the group
                     database as a group name (see getgrnam()), the numeric
                     group ID associated with that group name shall be used
                     as the group ID.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The file /dev/tty shall be used to read a single line of text for
           password checking, when one is required.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           newgrp:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and a
           prompt string for a password, if one is required. Diagnostic
           messages may be written in cases where the exit status is not
           available. See the EXIT STATUS section.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           If newgrp succeeds in creating a new shell execution environment,
           whether or not the group identification was changed successfully,
           the exit status shall be the exit status of the shell. Otherwise,
           the following exit value shall be returned:
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           The invoking shell may terminate.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           There is no convenient way to enter a password into the group
           database. Use of group passwords is not encouraged, because by
           their very nature they encourage poor security practices. Group
           passwords may disappear in the future.
           A common implementation of newgrp is that the current shell uses
           exec to overlay itself with newgrp, which in turn overlays itself
           with a new shell after changing group.  On some implementations,
           however, this may not occur and newgrp may be invoked as a
           subprocess.
           The newgrp command is intended only for use from an interactive
           terminal. It does not offer a useful interface for the support of
           applications.
           The exit status of newgrp is generally inapplicable. If newgrp is
           used in a script, in most cases it successfully invokes a new
           shell and the rest of the original shell script is bypassed when
           the new shell exits. Used interactively, newgrp displays
           diagnostic messages to indicate problems. But usage such as:
               newgrp foo
               echo $?
           is not useful because the new shell might not have access to any
           status newgrp may have generated (and most historical systems do
           not provide this status). A zero status echoed here does not
           necessarily indicate that the user has changed to the new group
           successfully. Following newgrp with the id command provides a
           portable means of determining whether the group change was
           successful or not.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           Most historical implementations use one of the exec functions to
           implement the behavior of newgrp.  Errors detected before the
           exec leave the environment unchanged, while errors detected after
           the exec leave the user in a changed environment. While it would
           be useful to have newgrp issue a diagnostic message to tell the
           user that the environment changed, it would be inappropriate to
           require this change to some historical implementations.
           The password mechanism is allowed in the group database, but how
           this would be implemented is not specified.
           The newgrp utility was retained in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
           even given the existence of the multiple group permissions
           feature in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, for
           several reasons. First, in some implementations, the group
           ownership of a newly created file is determined by the group of
           the directory in which the file is created, as allowed by the
           System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017; on other
           implementations, the group ownership of a newly created file is
           determined by the effective group ID. On implementations of the
           latter type, newgrp allows files to be created with a specific
           group ownership. Finally, many implementations use the real group
           ID in accounting, and on such systems, newgrp allows the
           accounting identity of the user to be changed.

           None.
