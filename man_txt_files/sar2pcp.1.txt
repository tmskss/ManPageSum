    SAR2PCP(1)               General Commands Manual              SAR2PCP(1)
## NAME         top
           sar2pcp - import sar data and create a PCP archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           sar2pcp infile outfile
## DESCRIPTION         top
           sar2pcp is intended to read a binary System Activity Reporting
           (sar) data file as created by sadc(1) (infile) and translate this
           into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with the basename
           outfile.
           However, if infile has the suffix ``.xml'', then it will be
           considered already in XML format and sar2pcp will operate
           directly on it.
           The resultant PCP achive may be used with all the PCP client
           tools to graph subsets of the data using pmchart(1), perform data
           reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
           pmie(1), etc.
           A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
           outfile.  These are outfile.0 (the performance data),
           outfile.meta (the metadata that describes the performance data)
           and outfile.index (a temporal index to improve efficiency of
           replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
           already, then sar2pcp will not overwrite them and will exit with
           an error message of the form
           __pmLogNewFile: ``blah.0'' already exists, not over-written
           sar2pcp is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
           wrapper around the PCP libpcp_import library, and as such could
           be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
           of performance data and create PCP archives.  A Python wrapper
           module is also available.
## NOTES         top
           As of sysstat version 12.0.5, sadc(1) has added functionality to
           directly write PCP archive files.  To produce archive files from
           sar run:
           $ sadf -l -O pcparchive=ARCHIVE_NAME sar.dat -- -A
## CAVEATS         top
           When not using the XML input option, sar2pcp requires infile to
           have been created by a version of sadc(1) from
           http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/ which includes the
           sadf(1) utility to translate infile into an XML stream (any since
           version 6); sar2pcp will automatically run sadf(1) and translate
           the resultant XML into a PCP archive.
           When using binary sadc files it is important to ensure the
           installed sadf is compatible with the version of sadc that
           originally generated the binary files.  Simply assuming a newer
           installed version will work is unfortunately far too optimistic,
           and nor should one assume that binary data from different
           platforms (e.g. different endianness) will work - these issues
           are due to limitations in sadc and sadf, and not in sar2pcp
           itself.
           Fortunately, the sadf message indicating that an incompatibility
           has been detected is consistent across versions, and is always
           prefixed
           Invalid system activity file
           Using an XML infile has the advantage that the installed version
           of sadf is completely bypassed.  sar2pcp undertakes to transform
           any valid XML produced by any of the different variations of sadf
           into a valid PCP archive.  Any version of PCP will be able to
           interpret the archive files produced by any version of sar2pcp,
           and you are also free to move the binary PCP archive between
           different platforms, different hardware, even different operating
           systems - it Just Works (TM).
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
