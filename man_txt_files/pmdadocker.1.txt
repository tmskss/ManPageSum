## NAME         top
           pmdadocker - docker performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pmdadocker [-d domain] [-l logfile]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdadocker is a docker Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
           which exposes performance metrics as reported from the Docker
           Remote API.
           A brief description of the pmdadocker command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                docker.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdadocker is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
                log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           Remote API metric requests are activated automatically and are
           fetched on a timer.  This timer is represented as a by pmdadocker
           via the docker.control.timing.  By default, pmdadocker will be
           set to fetch on a 1 second interval.
           pmdadocker will iterate over three different docker remote API
           calls:
           /containers/$ID/json
                  Container metrics regarding the current state of the
                  container. Such as PID, name or if the container is
                  running.
           /version
                  Basic version metrics about the current docker deamon in
                  use.
           /containers/$ID/stats?stream=0
                  More in depth memory and cpu metrics of the container.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           docker performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/docker
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation (and remove both PMDAs), do
           the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/docker
                # ./Remove
           pmdadocker is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH
                  command line options used to launch pmdadocker
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/docker/help
                  default help text file for the docker metrics
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/docker/Install
                  installation script for the pmdadocker agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/docker/Remove
                  undo installation script for the pmdadocker agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/docker.log
                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdadocker
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).  In particular, the $PCP_DOCKER_DIR may be set to
           change the default directory from /var/lib/docker.
