## NAME         top
           dh_installmanpages - old-style man page installer (deprecated)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installmanpages [debhelper options] [file ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installmanpages is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           automatically installing man pages into usr/share/man/ in package
           build directories.
           This is a DWIM-style program, with an interface unlike the rest
           of debhelper. It is deprecated, and you are encouraged to use
           dh_installman(1) instead.
           dh_installmanpages scans the current directory and all
           subdirectories for filenames that look like man pages. (Note that
           only real files are looked at; symlinks are ignored.) It uses
           file(1) to verify that the files are in the correct format. Then,
           based on the files' extensions, it installs them into the correct
           man directory.
           All filenames specified as parameters will be skipped by
           dh_installmanpages.  This is useful if by default it installs
           some man pages that you do not want to be installed.
           After the man page installation step, dh_installmanpages will
           check to see if any of the man pages are .so links. If so, it
           changes them to symlinks.
## OPTIONS         top
           file ...
               Do not install these files as man pages, even if they look
               like valid man pages.
## BUGS         top
           dh_installmanpages will install the man pages it finds into all
           packages you tell it to act on, since it can't tell what package
           the man pages belong in. This is almost never what you really
           want (use -p to work around this, or use the much better
           dh_installman(1) program instead).
           Files ending in .man will be ignored.
           Files specified as parameters that contain spaces in their
           filenames will not be processed properly.
