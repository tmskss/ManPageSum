## NAME         top
           danetool - GnuTLS DANE tool
## SYNOPSIS         top
           danetool [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]
           All arguments must be options.
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Tool to generate and check DNS resource records for the DANE
           protocol.
## OPTIONS         top
           -d num, --debug=num
                  Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as
                  its argument.  The value of num is constrained to being:
                      in the range 0 through 9999
                  Specifies the debug level.
           -V, --verbose
                  More verbose output.
           --outfile=str
                  Output file.
           --load-pubkey=str
                  Loads a public key file.
                  This can be either a file or a PKCS #11 URL
           --load-certificate=str
                  Loads a certificate file.
                  This can be either a file or a PKCS #11 URL
           --dlv=str
                  Sets a DLV file.
                  This sets a DLV file to be used for DNSSEC verification.
           --hash=str
                  Hash algorithm to use for signing.
                  Available hash functions are SHA1, RMD160, SHA256, SHA384,
                  SHA512.
           --check=str
                  Check a host's DANE TLSA entry.
                  Obtains the DANE TLSA entry from the given hostname and
                  prints information. Note that the actual certificate of
                  the host can be provided using --load-certificate,
                  otherwise danetool will connect to the server to obtain
                  it. The exit code on verification success will be zero.
           --check-ee
                  Check only the end-entity's certificate.
                  Checks the end-entity's certificate only. Trust anchors or
                  CAs are not considered.
           --check-ca
                  Check only the CA's certificate.
                  Checks the trust anchor's and CA's certificate only.
                  End-entities are not considered.
           --tlsa-rr
                  Print the DANE RR data on a certificate or public key.
                  This option must appear in combination with the following
                  options: host.
                  This command prints the DANE RR data needed to enable DANE
                  on a DNS server.
           --host=hostname
                  Specify the hostname to be used in the DANE RR.
                  This command sets the hostname for the DANE RR.
           --proto=protocol
                  The protocol set for DANE data (tcp, udp etc.).
                  This command specifies the protocol for the service set in
                  the DANE data.
           --port=str
                  The port or service to connect to, for DANE data.
           --app-proto
                  This is an alias for the --starttls-proto option.
           --starttls-proto=str
                  The application protocol to be used to obtain the server's
                  certificate (https, ftp, smtp, imap, ldap, xmpp, lmtp,
                  pop3, nntp, sieve, postgres).
                  When the server's certificate isn't provided danetool will
                  connect to the server to obtain the certificate. In that
                  case it is required to know the protocol to talk with the
                  server prior to initiating the TLS handshake.
           --ca   Whether the provided certificate or public key is a
                  Certificate Authority.
                  Marks the DANE RR as a CA certificate if specified.
           --x509 Use the hash of the X.509 certificate, rather than the
                  public key.
                  This option forces the generated record to contain the
                  hash of the full X.509 certificate. By default only the
                  hash of the public key is used.
           --local
                  This is an alias for the --domain option.
           --domain, --no-domain
                  The provided certificate or public key is issued by the
                  local domain.  The no-domain form will disable the option.
                  This option is enabled by default.
                  DANE distinguishes certificates and public keys offered
                  via the DNSSEC to trusted and local entities. This flag
                  indicates that this is a domain-issued certificate,
                  meaning that there could be no CA involved.
           --local-dns, --no-local-dns
                  Use the local DNS server for DNSSEC resolving.  The
                  no-local-dns form will disable the option.
                  This option will use the local DNS server for DNSSEC.
                  This is disabled by default due to many servers not
                  allowing DNSSEC.
           --insecure
                  Do not verify any DNSSEC signature.
                  Ignores any DNSSEC signature verification results.
           --inder, --no-inder
                  Use DER format for input certificates and private keys.
                  The no-inder form will disable the option.
                  The input files will be assumed to be in DER or RAW
                  format.  Unlike options that in PEM input would allow
                  multiple input data (e.g. multiple certificates), when
                  reading in DER format a single data structure is read.
           --inraw
                  This is an alias for the --inder option.
           --print-raw, --no-print-raw
                  Print the received DANE data in raw format.  The
                  no-print-raw form will disable the option.
                  This option will print the received DANE data.
           --quiet
                  Suppress several informational messages.
                  In that case on the exit code can be used as an indication
                  of verification success
           -v arg, --version=arg
                  Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is
                  `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright
                  information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.
           -h, --help
                  Display usage information and exit.
           -!, --more-help
                  Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
## EXAMPLES         top
           DANE TLSA RR generation
           To create a DANE TLSA resource record for a certificate (or
           public key) that was issued locally and may or may not be signed
           by a CA use the following command.
               $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem
           To create a DANE TLSA resource record for a CA signed
           certificate, which will be marked as such use the following
           command.
               $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem   --no-domain
           The former is useful to add in your DNS entry even if your
           certificate is signed by a CA. That way even users who do not
           trust your CA will be able to verify your certificate using DANE.
           In order to create a record for the CA signer of your certificate
           use the following.
               $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem   --ca --no-domain
           To read a server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
               $ danetool --check www.example.com --proto tcp --port 443
           To verify an HTTPS server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
               $ danetool --check www.example.com --proto tcp --port 443 --load-certificate chain.pem
           To verify an SMTP server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
               $ danetool --check www.example.com --proto tcp --starttls-proto=smtp --load-certificate chain.pem
## EXIT STATUS         top
           One of the following exit values will be returned:
           0  (EXIT_SUCCESS)
                  Successful program execution.
           1  (EXIT_FAILURE)
                  The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
