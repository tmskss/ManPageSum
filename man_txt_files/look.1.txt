    LOOK(1)                       User Commands                      LOOK(1)
## NAME         top
           look - display lines beginning with a given string
## SYNOPSIS         top
           look [options] string [file]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The look utility displays any lines in file which contain string
           as a prefix. As look performs a binary search, the lines in file
           must be sorted (where sort(1) was given the same options -d
           and/or -f that look is invoked with).
           If file is not specified, the file /usr/share/dict/words is used,
           only alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of
           alphabetic characters is ignored.
## OPTIONS         top
           -a, --alternative
               Use the alternative dictionary file.
           -d, --alphanum
               Use normal dictionary character set and order, i.e., only
               blanks and alphanumeric characters are compared. This is on
               by default if no file is specified.
               Note that blanks have been added to dictionary character set
               for compatibility with sort -d command since version 2.28.
           -f, --ignore-case
               Ignore the case of alphabetic characters. This is on by
               default if no file is specified.
           -t, --terminate character
               Specify a string termination character, i.e., only the
               characters in string up to and including the first occurrence
               of character are compared.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
           The look utility exits 0 if one or more lines were found and
           displayed, 1 if no lines were found, and >1 if an error occurred.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           WORDLIST
               Path to a dictionary file. The environment variable has
               greater priority than the dictionary path defined in the
               FILES segment.
## FILES         top
           /usr/share/dict/words
               the dictionary
           /usr/share/dict/web2
               the alternative dictionary
## HISTORY         top
           The look utility appeared in Version 7 AT&T Unix.
## EXAMPLES         top
               sort -d /etc/passwd -o /tmp/look.dict
               look -t: root:foobar /tmp/look.dict
## SEE ALSO         top
           grep(1), sort(1)
## REPORTING BUGS         top
