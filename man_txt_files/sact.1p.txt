## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           sact — print current SCCS file-editing activity (DEVELOPMENT)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           sact file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The sact utility shall inform the user of any impending deltas to
           a named SCCS file by writing a list to standard output. This
           situation occurs when get -e has been executed previously without
           a subsequent execution of delta, unget, or sccs unedit.
## OPTIONS         top
           None.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of an existing SCCS file or a directory. If
                     file is a directory, the sact utility shall behave as
                     though each file in the directory were specified as a
                     named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component
                     of the pathname does not begin with s.)  and unreadable
                     files shall be silently ignored.
                     If exactly one file operand appears, and it is '-', the
                     standard input shall be read; each line of the standard
                     input shall be taken to be the name of an SCCS file to
                     be processed. Non-SCCS files and unreadable files shall
                     be silently ignored.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be a text file used only when the file
           operand is specified as '-'.  Each line of the text file shall be
           interpreted as an SCCS pathname.
## INPUT FILES         top
           Any SCCS files interrogated are files of an unspecified format.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           sact:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The output for each named file shall consist of a line in the
           following format:
               "%s %s %s %s %s\n", <SID>, <new SID>, <login>, <date>, <time>
           <SID>     Specifies the SID of a delta that currently exists in
                     the SCCS file to which changes are made to make the new
                     delta.
           <new SID> Specifies the SID for the new delta to be created.
           <login>   Contains the login name of the user who makes the delta
                     (that is, who executed a get for editing).
           <date>    Contains the date that get -e was executed, in the
                     format used by the prs :D: data keyword.
           <time>    Contains the time that get -e was executed, in the
                     format used by the prs :T: data keyword.
           If there is more than one named file or if a directory or
           standard input is named, each pathname shall be written before
           each of the preceding lines:
               "\n%s:\n", <pathname>
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for optional informative
           messages concerning SCCS files with no impending deltas, and for
           diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
