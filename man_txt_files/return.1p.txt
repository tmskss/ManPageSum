    RETURN(1P)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             RETURN(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           return â€” return from a function or dot script
## SYNOPSIS         top
           return [n]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The return utility shall cause the shell to stop executing the
           current function or dot script. If the shell is not currently
           executing a function or dot script, the results are unspecified.
## OPTIONS         top
           None.
## OPERANDS         top
           See the DESCRIPTION.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           None.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The value of the special parameter '?'  shall be set to n, an
           unsigned decimal integer, or to the exit status of the last
           command executed if n is not specified. If n is not an unsigned
           decimal integer, or is greater than 255, the results are
           unspecified. When return is executed in a trap action, the last
           command is considered to be the command that executed immediately
           preceding the trap action.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           The behavior of return when not in a function or dot script
           differs between the System V shell and the KornShell. In the
           System V shell this is an error, whereas in the KornShell, the
           effect is the same as exit.
           The results of returning a number greater than 255 are undefined
           because of differing practices in the various historical
           implementations. Some shells AND out all but the low-order 8
           bits; others allow larger values, but not of unlimited size.
           See the discussion of appropriate exit status values under
           exit(1p).
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
