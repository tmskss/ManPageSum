## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           rmdel — remove a delta from an SCCS file (DEVELOPMENT)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           rmdel -r SID file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The rmdel utility shall remove the delta specified by the SID
           from each named SCCS file. The delta to be removed shall be the
           most recent delta in its branch in the delta chain of each named
           SCCS file. In addition, the application shall ensure that the SID
           specified is not that of a version being edited for the purpose
           of making a delta; that is, if a p-file (see get(1p)) exists for
           the named SCCS file, the SID specified shall not appear in any
           entry of the p-file.
           Removal of a delta shall be restricted to:
            1. The user who made the delta
            2. The owner of the SCCS file
            3. The owner of the directory containing the SCCS file
## OPTIONS         top
           The rmdel utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following option shall be supported:
           -r SID    Specify the SCCS identification string (SID) of the
                     delta to be deleted.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of an existing SCCS file or a directory. If
                     file is a directory, the rmdel utility shall behave as
                     though each file in the directory were specified as a
                     named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component
                     of the pathname does not begin with s.)  and unreadable
                     files shall be silently ignored.
                     If exactly one file operand appears, and it is '-', the
                     standard input shall be read; each line of the standard
                     input is taken to be the name of an SCCS file to be
                     processed. Non-SCCS files and unreadable files shall be
                     silently ignored.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be a text file used only when the file
           operand is specified as '-'.  Each line of the text file shall be
           interpreted as an SCCS pathname.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The SCCS files shall be files of unspecified format.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           rmdel:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           The SCCS files shall be files of unspecified format. During
           processing of a file, a temporary x-file, as described in
           admin(1p), may be created and deleted; a locking z-file, as
           described in get(1p), may be created and deleted.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
