## DESCRIPTION         top
           This command does assorted sanity tests, initially through linked
           routines but also will look for a directory with more tests in
           the form of scripts.
           To get a list of available tests use perf test list, specifying a
           test name fragment will show all tests that have it.
           To run just specific tests, inform test name fragments or the
           numbers obtained from perf test list.

               Be more verbose.
           -F, --dont-fork
               Do not fork child for each test, run all tests within single
               process.
