## NAME         top
           unexpand - convert spaces to tabs
## SYNOPSIS         top
           unexpand [OPTION]... [FILE]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Convert blanks in each FILE to tabs, writing to standard output.
           With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -a, --all
                  convert all blanks, instead of just initial blanks
           --first-only
                  convert only leading sequences of blanks (overrides -a)
           -t, --tabs=N
                  have tabs N characters apart instead of 8 (enables -a)
           -t, --tabs=LIST
                  use comma separated list of tab positions.  The last
                  specified position can be prefixed with '/' to specify a
                  tab size to use after the last explicitly specified tab
                  stop.  Also a prefix of '+' can be used to align remaining
                  tab stops relative to the last specified tab stop instead
                  of the first column
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
