## NAME         top
           cksum - compute and verify file checksums
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cksum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Print or verify checksums.  By default use the 32 bit CRC
           algorithm.
           With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -a, --algorithm=TYPE
                  select the digest type to use.  See DIGEST below.
           -b, --base64
                  emit base64-encoded digests, not hexadecimal
           -c, --check
                  read checksums from the FILEs and check them
           -l, --length=BITS
                  digest length in bits; must not exceed the max for the
                  blake2 algorithm and must be a multiple of 8
           --raw  emit a raw binary digest, not hexadecimal
           --tag  create a BSD-style checksum (the default)
           --untagged
                  create a reversed style checksum, without digest type
           -z, --zero
                  end each output line with NUL, not newline, and disable
                  file name escaping
       The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
           --ignore-missing
                  don't fail or report status for missing files
           --quiet
                  don't print OK for each successfully verified file
           --status
                  don't output anything, status code shows success
           --strict
                  exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
           -w, --warn
                  warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
           --debug
                  indicate which implementation used
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
       DIGEST determines the digest algorithm and default output format:
           sysv   (equivalent to sum -s)
           bsd    (equivalent to sum -r)
           crc    (equivalent to cksum)
           md5    (equivalent to md5sum)
           sha1   (equivalent to sha1sum)
           sha224 (equivalent to sha224sum)
           sha256 (equivalent to sha256sum)
           sha384 (equivalent to sha384sum)
           sha512 (equivalent to sha512sum)
           blake2b
                  (equivalent to b2sum)
           sm3    (only available through cksum)
           When checking, the input should be a former output of this
           program, or equivalent standalone program.
