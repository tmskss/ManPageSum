    NOHUP(1)                      User Commands                     NOHUP(1)
## NAME         top
           nohup - run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non-tty
## SYNOPSIS         top
           nohup COMMAND [ARG]...
           nohup OPTION
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Run COMMAND, ignoring hangup signals.
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           If standard input is a terminal, redirect it from an unreadable
           file.  If standard output is a terminal, append output to
           'nohup.out' if possible, '$HOME/nohup.out' otherwise.  If
           standard error is a terminal, redirect it to standard output.  To
           save output to FILE, use 'nohup COMMAND > FILE'.
           NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually
           supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your
           shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
       Exit status:
           125    if the nohup command itself fails
           126    if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked
           127    if COMMAND cannot be found
           -      the exit status of COMMAND otherwise
