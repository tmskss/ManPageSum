## DESCRIPTION         top
           Output pieces of FILE separated by PATTERN(s) to files 'xx00',
           'xx01', ..., and output byte counts of each piece to standard
           output.
           Read standard input if FILE is -
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -b, --suffix-format=FORMAT
                  use sprintf FORMAT instead of %02d
           -f, --prefix=PREFIX
                  use PREFIX instead of 'xx'
           -k, --keep-files

           --suppress-matched

           -n, --digits=DIGITS
                  use specified number of digits instead of 2
           -s, --quiet, --silent
                  do not print counts of output file sizes
           -z, --elide-empty-files
                  suppress empty output files
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
       Each PATTERN may be:
           INTEGER
                  copy up to but not including specified line number
           /REGEXP/[OFFSET]
                  copy up to but not including a matching line
           %REGEXP%[OFFSET]
                  skip to, but not including a matching line
           {INTEGER}
                  repeat the previous pattern specified number of times
           {*}    repeat the previous pattern as many times as possible
           A line OFFSET is an integer optionally preceded by '+' or '-'
