## NAME         top
           dh_auto_configure - automatically configure a package prior to
           building
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_auto_configure [build system options] [debhelper options]
           [-- params]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_auto_configure is a debhelper program that tries to
           automatically configure a package prior to building. It does so
           by running the appropriate command for the build system it
           detects the package uses.  For example, it looks for and runs a
           ./configure script, Makefile.PL, Build.PL, or cmake. A standard
           set of parameters is determined and passed to the program that is
           run. Some build systems, such as make, do not need a configure
           step; for these dh_auto_configure will exit without doing
           anything.
           This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
           work, you're encouraged to skip using dh_auto_configure at all,
           and just run ./configure or its equivalent manually.
## OPTIONS         top
           See "BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS" in debhelper(7) for a list of common
           build system selection and control options.
           -- params
               Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters
               that dh_auto_configure usually passes. For example:
                 dh_auto_configure -- --with-foo --enable-bar
## SEE ALSO         top
