## NAME         top
           lsipc - show information on IPC facilities currently employed in
           the system
## SYNOPSIS         top
           lsipc [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           lsipc shows information on the System V inter-process
           communication facilities for which the calling process has read
           access.
## OPTIONS         top
           -i, --id id
               Show full details on just the one resource element identified
               by id. This option needs to be combined with one of the three
               resource options: -m, -q or -s. It is possible to override
               the default output format for this option with the --list,
               --raw, --json or --export option.
           -g, --global
               Show system-wide usage and limits of IPC resources. This
               option may be combined with one of the three resource
               options: -m, -q or -s. The default is to show information
               about all resources.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
       Resource options
           -m, --shmems
               Write information about active shared memory segments.
           -q, --queues
               Write information about active message queues.
           -s, --semaphores
               Write information about active semaphore sets.
       Output formatting
           -c, --creator
               Show creator and owner.
           -e, --export
               Produce output in the form of key="value" pairs. All
               potentially unsafe value characters are hex-escaped
               (\x<code>). See also option --shell.
           -J, --json
               Use the JSON output format.
           -l, --list
               Use the list output format. This is the default, except when
               --id is used.
           -n, --newline
               Display each piece of information on a separate line.
           --noheadings
               Do not print a header line.
           --notruncate
               Don’t truncate output.
           -o, --output list
               Specify which output columns to print. Use --help to get a
               list of all supported columns.
           -b, --bytes
               Print size in bytes rather than in human readable format.
           -r, --raw
               Raw output (no columnation).
           -t, --time
               Write time information. The time of the last control
               operation that changed the access permissions for all
               facilities, the time of the last msgsnd(2) and msgrcv(2)
               operations on message queues, the time of the last shmat(2)
               and shmdt(2) operations on shared memory, and the time of the
               last semop(2) operation on semaphores.
           --time-format type
               Display dates in short, full or iso format. The default is
               short, this time format is designed to be space efficient and
               human readable.
           -P, --numeric-perms
               Print numeric permissions in PERMS column.
           -y, --shell
               The column name will be modified to contain only characters
               allowed for shell variable identifiers. This is usable, for
               example, with --export. Note that this feature has been
               automatically enabled for --export in version 2.37, but due
               to compatibility issues, now it’s necessary to request this
               behavior by --shell.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0
               if OK,
           1
               if incorrect arguments specified,
           2
               if a serious error occurs.
## HISTORY         top
           The lsipc utility is inspired by the ipcs(1) utility.
