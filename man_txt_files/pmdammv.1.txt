## NAME         top
           pmdammv - memory mapped values performance metrics domain agent
           (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv/pmdammv [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-U username]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdammv is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports application level performance metrics using memory mapped
           files.  It offers an extremely low overhead instrumentation
           facility that is well-suited to long running, mission critical
           applications where it is desirable to have performance metrics
           and availability information permanently enabled.
           The mmv PMDA exports instrumentation that has been added to an
           application using the MMV APIs (refer to mmv_stats_init(3) and
           mmv(5) for further details).  These APIs can be called from
           several languages, including C, C++, Perl, Python, Java (via the
           separate ``Parfait'' class library) and GoLang (via the separate
           ``Speed'' library).
           A brief description of the pmdammv command line options follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                mmv.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
                pmdammv is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
                file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
                to the standard error instead.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Firstly, a security model for interprocess communication between
           instrumented applications and pmdammv (running as a shared
           library inside pmcd) must be chosen and established.
           This communication occurs through memory mapped files in a
           location known to both pmdammv and the instrumented applications.
           That location is $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv, although that is often hidden
           behind application APIs such as ``Parfait'' and
           mmv_stats_init(3).  The permissions set on this directory
           indicate the security model in use.
           The more secure method is to use an existing unprivileged group
           which is shared by instrumented applications, pmcd and pmdammv
           such as the "pcp" group.
                # . /etc/pcp.env
                # mkdir -m 775 $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv
                # chgrp pcp $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv
           Since this method requires instrumented applications to use this
           non-default group (see newgrp(1) and setgid(2)) a common
           alternative involves the use of a world-writeable
           $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv directory with the sticky-bit set (similar to
           /tmp and /var/tmp, for example).
           This allows any application, running under any user account, to
           communicate with the PMDA (which runs under the "pcp" account by
           default).  This may not be desirable for all environments and one
           should consider the security implications of any directory setup
           like this (similar classes of issues exist as those that affect
           the system temporary file directories).
           pmdammv is enabled by default on all modern PCP installations,
           and thus the names, help text and values for the mmv performance
           metrics are available without the usual PMDA ./Install process.
           If the $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv directory does not exist, then the
           ./Install script can be used to create a world-writeable sticky-
           bit-set directory for communication.  This is for backwards
           compatibility, as well as ease of use - to use this mechanism, do
           the following as root:
                # rmdir $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv
                # ./Install
           This installation process will not overwrite any existing
           $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv directory.
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv
                # ./Remove
           pmdammv is launched by pmcd and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd when the
           agent is installed or removed.

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
