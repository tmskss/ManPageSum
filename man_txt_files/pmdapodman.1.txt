## NAME         top
           pmdapodman - podman container performance metrics domain agent
           (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman/pmdapodman [-d domain] [-l logfile]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           podman(1) is a utility for managing pods, containers and
           container images, following the container pod concept popularized
           by Kubernetes.  pmdapodman is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent
           (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics describing the state of
           containers and pods managed by podman.
           The podman PMDA exports metrics that measure information about
           individual containers and groups of containers, called pods.
           A brief description of the pmdapodman command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                podman.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdapodman is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
                log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
## INSTALLATION         top
           The podman PMDA is installed and available by default on Linux.
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman
                # ./Remove
           If you want to establish access to the names, help text and
           values for the podman performance metrics once more, after
           removal, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman
                # ./Install
           pmdapodman is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top

                  default help text file for the podman metrics
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman/Install
                  installation script for the pmdapodman agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman/Remove
                  undo installation script for the pmdapodman agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/podman.log
                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdapodman
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
