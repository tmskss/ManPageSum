## NAME         top
           dselect - Debian package management frontend
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dselect [option...] [command...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dselect is one of the primary user interfaces for managing
           packages on a Debian system. At the dselect main menu, the system
           administrator can:
           •   Update the list of available package versions,
           •   View the status of installed and available packages,
           •   Alter package selections and manage dependencies,
           •   Install new packages or upgrade to newer versions.
           dselect operates as a front-end to dpkg(1), the low-level Debian
           package handling tool. It features a full-screen package
           selections manager with package depends and conflicts resolver.
           When run with administrator privileges, packages can be
           installed, upgraded and removed. Various access methods can be
           configured to retrieve available package version information and
           installable packages from package repositories.  Depending on the
           used access method, these repositories can be public archive
           servers on the internet, local archive servers or CD-ROMs.  The
           recommended access method is apt, which is provided by the
           package apt(8).
           Normally dselect is invoked without parameters. An interactive
           menu is presented, offering the user a list of commands. If a
           command is given as argument, then that command is started
           immediately. Several command line parameters are still available
           to modify the running behaviour of dselect or show additional
           information about the program.
## OPTIONS         top
           All options can be specified both on the command line and in the
           dselect configuration file /usr/local/etc/dpkg/dselect.cfg or the
           files on the configuration directory
           /usr/local/etc/dpkg/dselect.cfg.d/. Each line in the
           configuration file is either an option (exactly the same as the
           command line option but without leading hyphens) or a comment (if
           it starts with a ‘#’).
           --admindir directory
               Changes the directory where the dpkg ‘status’, ‘available’
               and similar files are located.  Defaults to
               /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg if DPKG_ADMINDIR has not been set.
           --instdir directory
               Set the installation directory, which refers to the directory
               where packages get installed (since dpkg 1.21.2).  Defaults
               to «/» if DPKG_ROOT has not been set.
           --root directory
               Set the root directory to directory, which sets the
               installation directory to «directory» and the administrative
               directory to «directory/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» (since dpkg
               1.21.0).
           -Dfile, --debug file
               Turn on debugging. Debugging information is sent to file.
           --expert
               Turns on expert mode, i.e. doesn't display possibly annoying
               help messages.
           --color screenpart:[foreground],[background][:attr[+attr]...]
           --colour screenpart:[foreground],[background][:attr[+attr]...]
               Configures screen colors. This works only if your display
               supports colors.  This option may be used multiple times (and
               is best used in dselect.cfg). Each use changes the color (and
               optionally, other attributes) of one part of the screen.  The
               parts of the screen (from top to bottom) are:
               title
                   The screen title.
               listhead
                   The header line above the list of packages.
               list
                   The scrolling list of packages (and also some help text).
               listsel
                   The selected item in the list.
               pkgstate
                   In the list of packages, the text indicating the current
                   state of each package.
               pkgstatesel
                   In the list of packages, the text indicating the current
                   state of the currently selected package.
               infohead
                   The header line that displays the state of the currently
                   selected package.
               infodesc
                   The package's short description.
               info
                   Used to display package info such as the package's
                   description.
               infofoot
                   The last line of the screen when selecting packages.
               query
                   Used to display query lines
               helpscreen
                   Color of help screens.
               After the part of the screen comes a colon and the color
               specification. You can specify either the foreground color,
               the background color, or both, overriding the compiled-in
               colors. Use standard curses color names.
               Optionally, after the color specification is another colon,
               and an attribute specification. This is a list of one or more
               attributes, separated by plus (‘+’) characters.  Available
               attributes include (not all of these will work on all
               terminals): normal, standout, underline, reverse, blink,
               bright, dim, bold
           -?, --help
               Print a brief help text and exit successfully.
           --version
               Print version information and exit successfully.
## COMMANDS         top
           When dselect is started it can perform the following commands,
           either directly if it was specified on the command line or by
           prompting the user with a menu of available commands if running
           interactively:
       access
           Choose and configure an access method to access package
           repositories.
           By default, dselect provides several methods such as media, file
           or ftp, but other packages may provide additional methods, for
           example the apt access method provided by the apt(8) package.
           The use of the apt access method is strongly recommended.
       update
           Refresh the available packages database.
           Retrieves a list of available package versions from the package
           repository, configured for the current access method, and update
           the dpkg database. The package lists are commonly provided by the
           repository as files named Packages or Packages.gz.  These files
           can be generated by repository maintainers, using the program
           dpkg-scanpackages(1).
           Details of the update command depend on the access method's
           implementation.  Normally the process is straightforward and
           requires no user interaction.
       select
           View or manage package selections and dependencies.
           This is the main function of dselect. In the select screen, the
           user can review a list of all available and installed packages.
           When run with administrator privileges, it is also possible to
           interactively change packages selection state. dselect tracks the
           implications of these changes to other depending or conflicting
           packages.
           When a conflict or failed depends is detected, a dependency
           resolution subscreen is prompted to the user. In this screen, a
           list of conflicting or depending packages is shown, and for each
           package listed, the reason for its listing is shown. The user may
           apply the suggestions proposed by dselect, override them, or back
           out all the changes, including the ones that created the
           unresolved depends or conflicts.
           The use of the interactive package selections management screen
           is explained in more detail below.
       install
           Installs selected packages.
           The configured access method will fetch installable or upgradable
           packages from the relevant repositories and install these using
           dpkg.  Depending on the implementation of the access method, all
           packages can be prefetched before installation, or fetched when
           needed.  Some access methods may also remove packages that were
           marked for removal.
           If an error occurred during install, it is usually advisable to
           run install again. In most cases, the problems will disappear or
           be solved.  If problems persist or the installation performed was
           incorrect, please investigate into the causes and circumstances,
           and file a bug in the Debian bug tracking system. Instructions on
           how to do this can be found at <https://bugs.debian.org/> or by
           reading the documentation for bug(1) or reportbug(1), if these
           are installed.
           Details of the install command depend on the access method's
           implementation.  The user's attention and input may be required
           during installation, configuration or removal of packages. This
           depends on the maintainer scripts in the package. Some packages
           make use of the debconf(1) library, allowing for more flexible or
           even automated installation setups.
       config
           Configures any previously installed, but not fully configured
           packages.
       remove
           Removes or purges installed packages, that are marked for
           removal.
       quit
           Quit dselect.
           Exits the program with zero (successful) error code.
## PACKAGE SELECTIONS MANAGEMENT         top
       Introduction
           dselect directly exposes the administrator to some of the
           complexities involved with managing large sets of packages with
           many interdependencies. For a user who is unfamiliar with the
           concepts and the ways of the Debian package management system, it
           can be quite overwhelming. Although dselect is aimed at easing
           package management and administration, it is only instrumental in
           doing so and cannot be assumed to be a sufficient substitute for
           administrator skill and understanding. The user is required to be
           familiar with the concepts underlying the Debian packaging
           system.  In case of doubt, consult the dpkg(1) manpage and the
           distribution policy.
           Unless dselect is run in expert or immediate mode, a help screen
           is first displayed when choosing this command from the menu. The
           user is strongly advised to study all of the information
           presented in the online help screens, when one pops up.  The
           online help screens can at any time be invoked with the ‘?’ key.
       Screen layout
           The select screen is by default split in a top and a bottom half.
           The top half shows a list of packages. A cursor bar can select an
           individual package, or a group of packages, if applicable, by
           selecting the group header. The bottom half of the screen shows
           some details about the package currently selected in the top half
           of the screen.  The type of detail that is displayed can be
           varied.
           Pressing the ‘I’ key toggles a full-screen display of the
           packages list, an enlarged view of the package details, or the
           equally split screen.
       Package details view
           The package details view by default shows the extended package
           description for the package that is currently selected in the
           packages status list.  The type of detail can be toggled by
           pressing the ‘i’ key.  This alternates between:
           •   the extended description
           •   the control information for the installed version
           •   the control information for the available version
           In a dependency resolution screen, there is also the possibility
           of viewing the specific unresolved depends or conflicts related
           to the package and causing it to be listed.
       Packages status list
           The main select screen displays a list of all packages known to
           the Debian package management system. This includes packages
           installed on the system and packages known from the available
           packages database.
           For every package, the list shows the package's status, priority,
           section, installed and available architecture, installed and
           available versions, the package name and its short description,
           all in one line.  By pressing the ‘A’ key, the display of the
           installed and available architecture can be toggled between on an
           off.  By pressing the ‘V’ key, the display of the installed and
           available version can be toggled between on an off.  By pressing
           the ‘v’ key, the package status display is toggled between
           verbose and shorthand.  Shorthand display is the default.
           The shorthand status indication consists of four parts: an error
           flag, which should normally be clear, the current status, the
           last selection state and the current selection state.  The first
           two relate to the actual state of the package, the second pair
           are about the selections set by the user.
           These are the meanings of the shorthand package status indicator
           codes:
               Error flag:
               empty   no error
               R       serious error, needs reinstallation;
               Installed state:
               empty   not installed;
               *       fully installed and configured;
               -       not installed but some config files may remain;
               U       unpacked but not yet configured;
               C       half-configured (an error happened);
               I       half-installed (an error happened).
               Current and requested selections:
               *       marked for installation or upgrade;
               -       marked for removal, configuration files remain;
               =       on hold: package will not be processed at all;
               _       marked for purge, also remove configuration;
               n       package is new and has yet to be marked.
       Cursor and screen movement
           The package selection list and the dependency conflict resolution
           screens can be navigated using motion commands mapped to the
           following keys:
               p, Up, k           move cursor bar up
               n, Down, j         move cursor bar down
               P, Pgup, Backspace scroll list 1 page up
               N, Pgdn, Space     scroll list 1 page down
               ^p                 scroll list 1 line up
               ^n                 scroll list 1 line down
               t, Home            jump to top of list
               e, End             jump to end of list
               u                  scroll info 1 page up
               d                  scroll info 1 page down
               ^u                 scroll info 1 line up
               ^d                 scroll info 1 line down
               B, Left-arrow      pan display 1/3 screen left
               F, Right-arrow     pan display 1/3 screen right
               ^b                 pan display 1 character left
               ^f                 pan display 1 character right
       Searching and sorting
           The list of packages can be searched by package name. This is
           done by pressing ‘/’, and typing a simple search string. The
           string is interpreted as a regex(7) regular expression.  If you
           add ‘/d’ to the search expression, dselect will also search in
           descriptions.  If you add ‘/i’ the search will be case
           insensitive.  You may combine these two suffixes like this:
           ‘/id’.  Repeated searching is accomplished by repeatedly pressing
           the ‘n’ or ‘\’ keys, until the wanted package is found.  If the
           search reaches the bottom of the list, it wraps to the top and
           continues searching from there.
           The list sort order can be varied by pressing the ‘o’ and ‘O’
           keys repeatedly.  The following nine sort orderings can be
           selected:
               alphabet
               priority+section
               section+priority
               available
               available+priority
               available+section
               status
               status+priority
               status+section
           Where not listed above explicitly, alphabetic order is used as
           the final subordering sort key.
       Altering selections
           The requested selection state of individual packages may be
           altered with the following commands:
               +, Insert    install or upgrade
               =, H         hold in present state and version
               :, G         unhold: upgrade or leave uninstalled
               -, Delete    remove, but leave configuration
               _            remove & purge configuration
           When the change request results in one or more unsatisfied
           depends or conflicts, dselect prompts the user with a dependency
           resolution screen. This will be further explained below.
           It is also possible to apply these commands to groups of package
           selections, by pointing the cursor bar onto a group header. The
           exact grouping of packages is dependent on the current list
           ordering settings.
           Proper care should be taken when altering large groups of
           selections, because this can instantaneously create large numbers
           of unresolved depends or conflicts, all of which will be listed
           in one dependency resolution screen, making them very hard to
           handle. In practice, only hold and unhold operations are useful
           when applied to groups.
       Resolving depends and conflicts
           When the change request results in one or more unsatisfied
           depends or conflicts, dselect prompts the user with a dependency
           resolution screen. First however, an informative help screen is
           displayed.
           The top half of this screen lists all the packages that will have
           unresolved depends or conflicts, as a result of the requested
           change, and all the packages whose installation can resolve any
           of these depends or whose removal can resolve any of the
           conflicts.  The bottom half defaults to show the depends or
           conflicts that cause the currently selected package to be listed.
           When the sublist of packages is displayed initially, dselect may
           have already set the requested selection status of some of the
           listed packages, in order to resolve the depends or conflicts
           that caused the dependency resolution screen to be displayed.
           Usually, it is best to follow up the suggestions made by dselect.
           The listed packages' selection state may be reverted to the
           original settings, as they were before the unresolved depends or
           conflicts were created, by pressing the ‘R’ key.  By pressing the
           ‘D’ key, the automatic suggestions are reset, but the change that
           caused the dependency resolution screen to be prompted is kept as
           requested.  Finally, by pressing ‘U’, the selections are again
           set to the automatic suggestion values.
       Establishing the requested selections
           By pressing enter, the currently displayed set of selections is
           accepted. If dselect detects no unresolved depends as a result of
           the requested selections, the new selections will be set.
           However, if there are any unresolved depends, dselect will again
           prompt the user with a dependency resolution screen.
           To alter a set of selections that creates unresolved depends or
           conflicts and forcing dselect to accept it, press the ‘Q’ key.
           This sets the selections as specified by the user,
           unconditionally. Generally, don't do this unless you've read the
           fine print.
           The opposite effect, to back out any selections change requests
           and go back to the previous list of selections, is attained by
           pressing the ‘X’ or escape keys. By repeatedly pressing these
           keys, any possibly detrimental changes to the requested package
           selections can be backed out completely to the last established
           settings.
           If you mistakenly establish some settings and wish to revert all
           the selections to what is currently installed on the system,
           press the ‘C’ key.  This is somewhat similar to using the unhold
           command on all packages, but provides a more obvious panic button
           in cases where the user pressed enter by accident.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0   The requested command was successfully performed.
           2   Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
               usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to
               the database, memory allocations, etc.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           DPKG_ROOT
               If set and the --instdir or --root options have not been
               specified, it will be used as the filesystem root directory
               (since dpkg 1.21.0).
           DPKG_ADMINDIR
               If set and the --admindir or --root option have not been
               specified, it will be used as the dpkg database directory
               (since dpkg 1.21.0).
           HOME
               If set, dselect will use it as the directory from which to
               read the user specific configuration file.
## BUGS         top
           The dselect package selection interface is confusing to some new
           users.  Reportedly, it even makes seasoned kernel developers cry.
           The documentation is lacking.
           There is no help option in the main menu.
           The visible list of available packages cannot be reduced.
           The built in access methods can no longer stand up to current
           quality standards. Use the access method provided by apt(8), it
           is not only not broken, it is also much more flexible than the
           built in access methods.
