## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-stream - stream a trace to stdout as it is happening
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd stream [OPTIONS] [command]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) stream will start tracing just like
           trace-cmd-record(1), except it will not record to a file and
           instead it will read the binary buffer as it is happening,
           convert it to a human readable format and write it to stdout.
           This is basically the same as trace-cmd-start(1) and then doing a
           trace-cmd-show(1) with the -p option. trace-cmd-stream is not as
           efficient as reading from the pipe file as most of the stream
           work is done in userspace. This is useful if it is needed to do
           the work mostly in userspace instead of the kernel, and stream
           also helps to debug trace-cmd-profile(1) which uses the stream
           code to perform the live data analysis for the profile.
## OPTIONS         top
               These are the same as trace-cmd-record(1), except that it does not take
               the *-o* option.
