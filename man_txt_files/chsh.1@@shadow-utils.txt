# chsh(1) -- Linux manual page
NAME | SYNOPSIS | DESCRIPTION | OPTIONS | NOTE | FILES | SEE ALSO | COLOPHON  
    CHSH(1)                       User Commands                      CHSH(1)
## NAME         top
           chsh - change login shell
## SYNOPSIS         top
           chsh [options] [LOGIN]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The chsh command changes the user login shell. This determines
           the name of the user's initial login command. A normal user may
           only change the login shell for her own account; the superuser
           may change the login shell for any account.
## OPTIONS         top
           The options which apply to the chsh command are:
           -h, --help
               Display help message and exit.
           -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
               Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the
               configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR directory. Only
               absolute paths are supported.
           -s, --shell SHELL
               The name of the user's new login shell. Setting this field to
               blank causes the system to select the default login shell.
           If the -s option is not selected, chsh operates in an interactive
           fashion, prompting the user with the current login shell. Enter
           the new value to change the shell, or leave the line blank to use
           the current one. The current shell is displayed between a pair of
           [ ] marks.
## NOTE         top
           For this reason, placing /bin/rsh in /etc/shells is discouraged
           since accidentally changing to a restricted shell would prevent
           the user from ever changing her login shell back to its original
           value.
## FILES         top
           /etc/passwd
               User account information.
           /etc/shells
           /etc/login.defs
               Shadow password suite configuration.
## SEE ALSO         top
           chfn(1), login.defs(5), passwd(5).
