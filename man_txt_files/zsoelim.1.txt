## NAME         top
           zsoelim - satisfy .so requests in roff input
## SYNOPSIS         top
           zsoelim [-CVh] [file ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           zsoelim parses file arguments, or if none are specified, its
           standard input for lines of the form:
           .so <filename>
           These requests are replaced by the contents of the filename
           specified.  If the request cannot be met, zsoelim looks for
           filename.ext where .ext can be one of .gz, .Z or .z.  Other
           extension types may be supported depending upon compile time
           options.  If the request can be met by a compressed file, this
           file is decompressed using an appropriate decompressor and its
           output is used to satisfy the request.
           Traditionally, soelim programs were used to allow roff
           preprocessors to be able to preprocess the files referred to by
           the requests.  This particular version was written to circumvent
           problems created by support for compressed manual pages.
## OPTIONS         top
           -C, --compatible
                  This flag is available for compatibility with other soelim
                  programs.  Its use is to enable .so requests followed by
                  something other than whitespace.  As this is already the
                  default behaviour, it is ignored.
           -h, --help
                  Print a help message and exit.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information.
