## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           cxref — generate a C-language program cross-reference table
           (DEVELOPMENT)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cxref [-cs] [-o file] [-w num] [-D name[=def]]... [-I dir]...
               [-U name]... file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The cxref utility shall analyze a collection of C-language files
           and attempt to build a cross-reference table. Information from
           #define lines shall be included in the symbol table. A sorted
           listing shall be written to standard output of all symbols (auto,
           static, and global) in each file separately, or with the -c
           option, in combination. Each symbol shall contain an <asterisk>
           before the declaring reference.
## OPTIONS         top
           The cxref utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
           that the order of the -D, -I, and -U options (which are identical
           to their interpretation by c99) is significant. The following
           options shall be supported:
           -c        Write a combined cross-reference of all input files.
           -s        Operate silently; do not print input filenames.
           -o file   Direct output to named file.
           -w num    Format output no wider than num (decimal) columns. This
                     option defaults to 80 if num is not specified or is
                     less than 51.
           -D        Equivalent to c99.
           -I        Equivalent to c99.
           -U        Equivalent to c99.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of a C-language source file.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The input files are C-language source files.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           cxref:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_COLLATE
                     Determine the locale for the ordering of the output.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The standard output shall be used for the cross-reference
           listing, unless the -o option is used to select a different
           output file.
           The format of standard output is unspecified, except that the
           following information shall be included:
            *  If the -c option is not specified, each portion of the
               listing shall start with the name of the input file on a
               separate line.
            *  The name line shall be followed by a sorted list of symbols,
               each with its associated location pathname, the name of the
               function in which it appears (if it is not a function name
               itself), and line number references.
            *  Each line number may be preceded by an <asterisk> ('*') flag,
               meaning that this is the declaring reference. Other single-
               character flags, with implementation-defined meanings, may be
               included.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           The output file named by the -o option shall be used instead of
           standard output.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
