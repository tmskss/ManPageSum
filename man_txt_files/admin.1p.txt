## NAME         top
           admin — create and administer SCCS files (DEVELOPMENT)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           admin -i[name] [-n] [-a login] [-d flag] [-e login] [-f flag]
               [-m mrlist] [-r rel] [-t[name] [-y[comment]] newfile

           admin -z file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The admin utility shall create new SCCS files or change
           parameters of existing ones. If a named file does not exist, it
           shall be created, and its parameters shall be initialized
           according to the specified options.  Parameters not initialized
           by an option shall be assigned a default value. If a named file
           does exist, parameters corresponding to specified options shall
           be changed, and other parameters shall be left as is.
           All SCCS filenames supplied by the application shall be of the
           form s.filename. New SCCS files shall be given read-only
           permission mode. Write permission in the parent directory is
           required to create a file. All writing done by admin shall be to
           a temporary x-file, named x.filename (see get(1p)) created with
           read-only mode if admin is creating a new SCCS file, or created
           with the same mode as that of the SCCS file if the file already
           exists. After successful execution of admin, the SCCS file shall
           be removed (if it exists), and the x-file shall be renamed with
           the name of the SCCS file. This ensures that changes are made to
           the SCCS file only if no errors occur.
           The admin utility shall also use a transient lock file (named
           z.filename), which is used to prevent simultaneous updates to the
           SCCS file; see get(1p).
## OPTIONS         top
           The admin utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
           that the -i, -t, and -y options have optional option-arguments.
           These optional option-arguments shall not be presented as
           separate arguments. The following options are supported:
           -n        Create a new SCCS file. When -n is used without -i, the
                     SCCS file shall be created with control information but
                     without any file data.
           -i[name]  Specify the name of a file from which the text for a
                     new SCCS file shall be taken. The text constitutes the
                     first delta of the file (see the -r option for the
                     delta numbering scheme). If the -i option is used, but
                     the name option-argument is omitted, the text shall be
                     obtained by reading the standard input. If this option
                     is omitted, the SCCS file shall be created with control
                     information but without any file data. The -i option
                     implies the -n option.
           -r SID    Specify the SID of the initial delta to be inserted.
                     This SID shall be a trunk SID; that is, the branch and
                     sequence numbers shall be zero or missing. The level
                     number is optional, and defaults to 1.
           -t[name]  Specify the name of a file from which descriptive text
                     for the SCCS file shall be taken.  In the case of
                     existing SCCS files (neither -i nor -n is specified):
                      *  A -t option without a name option-argument shall
                         cause the removal of descriptive text (if any)
                         currently in the SCCS file.
                      *  A -t option with a name option-argument shall cause
                         the text (if any) in the named file to replace the
                         descriptive text (if any) currently in the SCCS
                         file.
           -f flag   Specify a flag, and, possibly, a value for the flag, to
                     be placed in the SCCS file. Several -f options may be
                     supplied on a single admin command line.
                     Implementations shall recognize the following flags and
                     associated values:
                     b       Allow use of the -b option on a get command to
                             create branch deltas.
                     cceil   Specify the highest release (that is, ceiling),
                             a number less than or equal to 9999, which may
                             be retrieved by a get command for editing. The
                             default value for an unspecified c flag shall
                             be 9999.
                     ffloor  Specify the lowest release (that is, floor), a
                             number greater than 0 but less than 9999, which
                             may be retrieved by a get command for editing.
                             The default value for an unspecified f flag
                             shall be 1.
                     dSID    Specify the default delta number (SID) to be
                             used by a get command.
                     istr    Treat the ``No ID keywords'' message issued by
                             get or delta as a fatal error. In the absence
                             of this flag, the message is only a warning.
                             The message is issued if no SCCS identification
                             keywords (see get(1p)) are found in the text
                             retrieved or stored in the SCCS file. If a
                             value is supplied, the application shall ensure
                             that the keywords exactly match the given
                             string; however, the string shall contain a
                             keyword, and no embedded <newline> characters.
                     j       Allow concurrent get commands for editing on
                             the same SID of an SCCS file. This allows
                             multiple concurrent updates to the same version
                             of the SCCS file.
                     llist   Specify a list of releases to which deltas can
                             no longer be made (that is, get -e against one
                             of these locked releases fails). Conforming
                             applications shall use the following syntax to
                             specify a list.  Implementations may accept
                             additional forms as an extension:
                                 <list> ::= a | <range-list>
                                 <range-list> ::= <range> | <range-list>, <range>
                                 <range> ::= <SID>
                             The character a in the list shall be equivalent
                             to specifying all releases for the named SCCS
                             file.  The non-terminal <SID> in range shall be
                             the delta number of an existing delta
                             associated with the SCCS file.
                     n       Cause delta to create a null delta in each of
                             those releases (if any) being skipped when a
                             delta is made in a new release (for example, in
                             making delta 5.1 after delta 2.7, releases 3
                             and 4 are skipped). These null deltas shall
                             serve as anchor points so that branch deltas
                             may later be created from them. The absence of
                             this flag shall cause skipped releases to be
                             nonexistent in the SCCS file, preventing branch
                             deltas from being created from them in the
                             future. During the initial creation of an SCCS
                             file, the n flag may be ignored; that is, if
                             the -r option is used to set the release number
                             of the initial SID to a value greater than 1,
                             null deltas need not be created for the
                             ``skipped'' releases.
                     qtext   Substitute user-definable text for all
                             occurrences of the %Q% keyword in the SCCS file
                             text retrieved by get.
                     mmod    Specify the module name of the SCCS file
                             substituted for all occurrences of the %M%
                             keyword in the SCCS file text retrieved by get.
                             If the m flag is not specified, the value
                             assigned shall be the name of the SCCS file
                             with the leading '.'  removed.
                     ttype   Specify the type of module in the SCCS file
                             substituted for all occurrences of the %Y%
                             keyword in the SCCS file text retrieved by get.
                     vpgm    Cause delta to prompt for modification request
                             (MR) numbers as the reason for creating a
                             delta. The optional value specifies the name of
                             an MR number validation program. (If this flag
                             is set when creating an SCCS file, the
                             application shall ensure that the m option is
                             also used even if its value is null.)
           -d flag   Remove (delete) the specified flag from an SCCS file.
                     Several -d options may be supplied on a single admin
                     command. See the -f option for allowable flag names.
                     (The llist flag gives a list of releases to be
                     unlocked. See the -f option for further description of
                     the l flag and the syntax of a list.)
           -a login  Specify a login name, or numerical group ID, to be
                     added to the list of users who may make deltas
                     (changes) to the SCCS file. A group ID shall be
                     equivalent to specifying all login names common to that
                     group ID. Several -a options may be used on a single
                     admin command line. As many logins, or numerical group
                     IDs, as desired may be on the list simultaneously.  If
                     the list of users is empty, then anyone may add deltas.
                     If login or group ID is preceded by a '!', the users so
                     specified shall be denied permission to make deltas.
           -e login  Specify a login name, or numerical group ID, to be
                     erased from the list of users allowed to make deltas
                     (changes) to the SCCS file. Specifying a group ID is
                     equivalent to specifying all login names common to that
                     group ID. Several -e options may be used on a single
                     admin command line.
           -y[comment]
                     Insert the comment text into the SCCS file as a comment
                     for the initial delta in a manner identical to that of
                     delta.  In the POSIX locale, omission of the -y option
                     shall result in a default comment line being inserted
                     in the form:
                         "date and time created %s %s by %s", <date>, <time>, <login>
                     where <date> is expressed in the format of the date
                     utility's %y/%m/%d conversion specification, <time> in
                     the format of the date utility's %T conversion
                     specification format, and <login> is the login name of
                     the user creating the file.
           -m mrlist Insert the list of modification request (MR) numbers
                     into the SCCS file as the reason for creating the
                     initial delta in a manner identical to delta.  The
                     application shall ensure that the v flag is set and the
                     MR numbers are validated if the v flag has a value (the
                     name of an MR number validation program).  A diagnostic
                     message shall be written if the v flag is not set or MR
                     validation fails.
           -h        Check the structure of the SCCS file and compare the
                     newly computed checksum with the checksum that is
                     stored in the SCCS file. If the newly computed checksum
                     does not match the checksum in the SCCS file, a
                     diagnostic message shall be written.
           -z        Recompute the SCCS file checksum and store it in the
                     first line of the SCCS file (see the -h option above).
                     Note that use of this option on a truly corrupted file
                     may prevent future detection of the corruption.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of an existing SCCS file or a directory. If
                     file is a directory, the admin utility shall behave as
                     though each file in the directory were specified as a
                     named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component
                     of the pathname does not begin with s.)  and unreadable
                     files shall be silently ignored.
           newfile   A pathname of an SCCS file to be created.
           If exactly one file or newfile operand appears, and it is '-',
           the standard input shall be read; each line of the standard input
           shall be taken to be the name of an SCCS file to be processed.
           Non-SCCS files and unreadable files shall be silently ignored.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be a text file used only if -i is
           specified without an option-argument or if a file or newfile
           operand is specified as '-'.  If the first character of any
           standard input line is <SOH> in the POSIX locale, the results are
           unspecified.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The existing SCCS files shall be text files of an unspecified
           format.
           The application shall ensure that the file named by the -i
           option's name option-argument shall be a text file; if the first
           character of any line in this file is <SOH> in the POSIX locale,
           the results are unspecified. If this file contains more than
           99999 lines, the number of lines recorded in the header for this
           file shall be 99999 for this delta.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           admin:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error and the contents of the default -y

           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           It is recommended that directories containing SCCS files be
           writable by the owner only, and that SCCS files themselves be
           read-only. The mode of the directories should allow only the
           owner to modify SCCS files contained in the directories. The mode
           of the SCCS files prevents any modification at all except by SCCS
           commands.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
