    JOIN(1)                       User Commands                      JOIN(1)
## NAME         top
           join - join lines of two files on a common field
## SYNOPSIS         top
           join [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2
## DESCRIPTION         top
           For each pair of input lines with identical join fields, write a
           line to standard output.  The default join field is the first,
           delimited by blanks.
           When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input.
           -a FILENUM
                  also print unpairable lines from file FILENUM, where
                  FILENUM is 1 or 2, corresponding to FILE1 or FILE2
           -e STRING
                  replace missing (empty) input fields with STRING; I.e.,
                  missing fields specified with '-12jo' options
           -i, --ignore-case
                  ignore differences in case when comparing fields
           -j FIELD
                  equivalent to '-1 FIELD -2 FIELD'
           -o FORMAT
                  obey FORMAT while constructing output line
           -t CHAR
                  use CHAR as input and output field separator
           -v FILENUM
                  like -a FILENUM, but suppress joined output lines
           -1 FIELD
                  join on this FIELD of file 1
           -2 FIELD
                  join on this FIELD of file 2
           --check-order
                  check that the input is correctly sorted, even if all
                  input lines are pairable
           --nocheck-order
                  do not check that the input is correctly sorted
           --header
                  treat the first line in each file as field headers, print
                  them without trying to pair them
           -z, --zero-terminated
                  line delimiter is NUL, not newline
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           Unless -t CHAR is given, leading blanks separate fields and are
           ignored, else fields are separated by CHAR.  Any FIELD is a field
           number counted from 1.  FORMAT is one or more comma or blank
           separated specifications, each being 'FILENUM.FIELD' or '0'.
           Default FORMAT outputs the join field, the remaining fields from
           FILE1, the remaining fields from FILE2, all separated by CHAR.
           If FORMAT is the keyword 'auto', then the first line of each file
           determines the number of fields output for each line.
           Important: FILE1 and FILE2 must be sorted on the join fields.
           E.g., use "sort -k 1b,1" if 'join' has no options, or use "join
           -t ''" if 'sort' has no options.  Note, comparisons honor the
           rules specified by 'LC_COLLATE'.  If the input is not sorted and
           some lines cannot be joined, a warning message will be given.
