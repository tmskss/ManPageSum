## NAME         top
           dh_installxfonts - register X fonts
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installxfonts [debhelper options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installxfonts is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           registering X fonts, so their corresponding fonts.dir,
           fonts.alias, and fonts.scale be rebuilt properly at install time.
           Before calling this program, you should have installed any X
           fonts provided by your package into the appropriate location in
           the package build directory, and if you have fonts.alias or
           fonts.scale files, you should install them into the correct
           location under etc/X11/fonts in your package build directory.
           Your package should depend on xfonts-utils so that the
           update-fonts-* commands are available. (This program adds that
           dependency to ${misc:Depends}.)
           This program automatically generates the postinst and postrm
           commands needed to register X fonts. These commands are inserted
           into the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb. See
           dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of how this works.
## NOTES         top
           See update-fonts-alias(8), update-fonts-scale(8), and
           update-fonts-dir(8) for more information about X font
           installation.
           See Debian policy, section 11.8.5. for details about doing fonts
           the Debian way.
