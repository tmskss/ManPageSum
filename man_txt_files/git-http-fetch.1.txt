## NAME         top
           git-http-fetch - Download from a remote Git repository via HTTP
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git http-fetch [-c] [-t] [-a] [-d] [-v] [-w <filename>] [--recover] [--stdin | --packfile=<hash> | <commit>] <URL>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Downloads a remote Git repository via HTTP.
           This command always gets all objects. Historically, there were
           three options -a, -c and -t for choosing which objects to
           download. They are now silently ignored.
## OPTIONS         top
           commit-id
               Either the hash or the filename under [URL]/refs/ to pull.
           -a, -c, -t
               These options are ignored for historical reasons.
           -v
               Report what is downloaded.
           -w <filename>
               Writes the commit-id into the filename under
               $GIT_DIR/refs/<filename> on the local end after the transfer
               is complete.
           --stdin
               Instead of a commit id on the command line (which is not
               expected in this case), git http-fetch expects lines on stdin
               in the format
                   <commit-id>['\t'<filename-as-in--w>]
           --packfile=<hash>
               For internal use only. Instead of a commit id on the command
               line (which is not expected in this case), git http-fetch
               fetches the packfile directly at the given URL and uses
               index-pack to generate corresponding .idx and .keep files.
               The hash is used to determine the name of the temporary file
               and is arbitrary. The output of index-pack is printed to
               stdout. Requires --index-pack-args.
           --index-pack-args=<args>
               For internal use only. The command to run on the contents of
               the downloaded pack. Arguments are URL-encoded separated by
               spaces.
           --recover
               Verify that everything reachable from target is fetched. Used
               after an earlier fetch is interrupted.
