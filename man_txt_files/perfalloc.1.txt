## NAME         top
           perfalloc - notify pmdaperfevent(1) to disable hardware counter
           allocation.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perfalloc [-D] [-d] [-f lockfile] [-h]
           [-v] [COMMAND]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           perfalloc is a command that notifies the pmdaperfevent(1) to
           disable hardware counter event collection.  This allow
           unprivileged processes to use the hardware counters.
           If the reservation request fails, then perfalloc exits
           immediately with exit code EXIT_FAILURE.  If successful, the
           perfalloc will run until a kill signal is received.  The
           reservation request persists while perfalloc is running.
           Note that pmdaperfevent is affected by the value of the
           kernel.perf_event_paranoid setting, which can be adjusted by
           sysctl(8).
           If a commandline is given, this is executed as a subprocess of
           the agent.  When the command dies, so does the agent.
           A brief description of the command line options follows:
           -D   run in the foreground (the default)
           -d   run in the background
           -f FILE
                use FILE as the lock file (default
                $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perflock)
           -h   display a help message and exit
           -v   output version number and exit
## BUGS         top
           There may be a delay of up to 100 miliseconds between perfalloc
           requesting the hardware counter disabling and the perfevent PMDA
           processing the request.
           The perfalloc process does not check the status of the request
           and therefore is not able to provide a positive confirmation that
           the request succeeded and the hardware counters are disabled.
