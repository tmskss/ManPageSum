## NAME         top
           flatpak-build-sign - Sign an application or runtime
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak build-sign [OPTION...] LOCATION ID [BRANCH]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Signs the commit for a specified application or runtime in a
           local repository.  LOCATION is the location of the repository.
           ID is the name of the application, or runtime if --runtime is
           specified. If BRANCH is not specified, it is assumed to be
           "master".
           Applications can also be signed during build-export, but it is
           sometimes useful to add additional signatures later.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           --gpg-sign=KEYID
               Sign the commit with this GPG key. This option can be used
               multiple times.
           --gpg-homedir=PATH
               GPG Homedir to use when looking for keyrings
           --runtime
               Sign a runtime instead of an app.
           --arch=ARCH
               The architecture to use. See flatpak --supported-arches for
               architectures supported by the host.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
## EXAMPLES         top
           $ flatpak build-sign
           --gpg-sign=D8BA6573DDD2418027736F1BC33B315E53C1E9D6 /some/repo

           This page is part of the flatpak (a tool for building and
           distributing desktop applications on Linux) project.  Information
           about the project can be found at ⟨http://flatpak.org/⟩.  It is
           not known how to report bugs for this man page; if you know,
           please send a mail to man-pages@man7.org.  This page was obtained
           from the project's upstream Git repository
           ⟨https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak⟩ on 2023-06-23.  (At that
           time, the date of the most recent commit that was found in the
           repository was 2023-05-20.)  If you discover any rendering
           problems in this HTML version of the page, or you believe there
           is a better or more up-to-date source for the page, or you have
           corrections or improvements to the information in this COLOPHON
