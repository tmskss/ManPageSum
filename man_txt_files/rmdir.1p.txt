    RMDIR(1P)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              RMDIR(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           rmdir — remove directories
## SYNOPSIS         top
           rmdir [-p] dir...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The rmdir utility shall remove the directory entry specified by
           each dir operand.
           For each dir operand, the rmdir utility shall perform actions
           equivalent to the rmdir() function called with the dir operand as
           its only argument.
           Directories shall be processed in the order specified. If a
           directory and a subdirectory of that directory are specified in a
           single invocation of the rmdir utility, the application shall
           specify the subdirectory before the parent directory so that the
           parent directory will be empty when the rmdir utility tries to
           remove it.
## OPTIONS         top
           The rmdir utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following option shall be supported:
           -p        Remove all directories in a pathname. For each dir
                     operand:
                      1. The directory entry it names shall be removed.
                      2. If the dir operand includes more than one pathname
                         component, effects equivalent to the following
                         command shall occur:
                             rmdir -p $(dirname dir)
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           dir       A pathname of an empty directory to be removed.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           rmdir:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Each directory entry specified by a dir operand was removed
                 successfully.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           The definition of an empty directory is one that contains, at
           most, directory entries for dot and dot-dot.
## EXAMPLES         top
           If a directory a in the current directory is empty except it
           contains a directory b and a/b is empty except it contains a
           directory c:
               rmdir -p a/b/c
           removes all three directories.
## RATIONALE         top
           On historical System V systems, the -p option also caused a
           message to be written to the standard output. The message
           indicated whether the whole path was removed or whether part of
           the path remained for some reason. The STDERR section requires
           this diagnostic when the entire path specified by a dir operand
           is not removed, but does not allow the status message reporting
           success to be written as a diagnostic.
           The rmdir utility on System V also included a -s option that
           suppressed the informational message output by the -p option.
           This option has been omitted because the informational message is
           not specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
