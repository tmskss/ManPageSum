## NAME         top
           scriptlive - re-run session typescripts, using timing information
## SYNOPSIS         top
           scriptlive [options] [-t] timingfile [-I|-B] typescript
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This program re-runs a typescript, using stdin typescript and
           timing information to ensure that input happens in the same
           rhythm as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.
           The session is executed in a newly created pseudoterminal with
           the user’s $SHELL (or defaults to /bin/bash).
           Be careful! Do not forget that the typescript may contains
           arbitrary commands. It is recommended to use "scriptreplay
           --stream in --log-in typescript" (or with --log-io instead of
           --log-in) to verify the typescript before it is executed by
           scriptlive.
           The timing information is what script(1) outputs to file
           specified by --log-timing. The typescript has to contain stdin
           information and it is what script1 outputs to file specified by
           --log-in or --log-io.
## OPTIONS         top
           -I, --log-in file
               File containing script's terminal input.
           -B, --log-io file
               File containing script's terminal output and input.
           -t, --timing file
               File containing script's timing output. This option overrides
               old-style arguments.
           -T, --log-timing file
               Aliased to -t, maintained for compatibility with script(1)
               command-line options.
           -d, --divisor number
               Speed up the replay displaying this number of times. The
               argument is a floating-point number. It’s called divisor
               because it divides the timings by this factor. This option
               overrides old-style arguments.
           -m, --maxdelay number
               Set the maximum delay between updates to number of seconds.
               The argument is a floating-point number. This can be used to
               avoid long pauses in the typescript replay.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## EXAMPLES         top
               % script --log-timing file.tm --log-in script.in
               Script started, file is script.out
               % date
               <etc, etc>
               % exit
               Script done, file is script.out
               % scriptlive --log-timing file.tm --log-in script.in
