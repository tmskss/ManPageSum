## NAME         top
           git-symbolic-ref - Read, modify and delete symbolic refs
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git symbolic-ref [-m <reason>] <name> <ref>
           git symbolic-ref [-q] [--short] [--no-recurse] <name>
           git symbolic-ref --delete [-q] <name>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Given one argument, reads which branch head the given symbolic
           ref refers to and outputs its path, relative to the .git/
           directory. Typically you would give HEAD as the <name> argument
           to see which branch your working tree is on.
           Given two arguments, creates or updates a symbolic ref <name> to
           point at the given branch <ref>.
           Given --delete and an additional argument, deletes the given
           symbolic ref.
           A symbolic ref is a regular file that stores a string that begins
           with ref: refs/. For example, your .git/HEAD is a regular file
           whose contents is ref: refs/heads/master.
## OPTIONS         top
           -d, --delete
               Delete the symbolic ref <name>.
           -q, --quiet
               Do not issue an error message if the <name> is not a symbolic
               ref but a detached HEAD; instead exit with non-zero status
               silently.
           --short
               When showing the value of <name> as a symbolic ref, try to
               shorten the value, e.g. from refs/heads/master to master.
           --recurse, --no-recurse
               When showing the value of <name> as a symbolic ref, if <name>
               refers to another symbolic ref, follow such a chain of
               symbolic refs until the result no longer points at a symbolic
               ref (--recurse, which is the default).  --no-recurse stops
               after dereferencing only a single level of symbolic ref.
           -m
               Update the reflog for <name> with <reason>. This is valid
               only when creating or updating a symbolic ref.
## NOTES         top
           In the past, .git/HEAD was a symbolic link pointing at
           refs/heads/master. When we wanted to switch to another branch, we
           did ln -sf refs/heads/newbranch .git/HEAD, and when we wanted to
           find out which branch we are on, we did readlink .git/HEAD. But
           symbolic links are not entirely portable, so they are now
           deprecated and symbolic refs (as described above) are used by
           default.
           git symbolic-ref will exit with status 0 if the contents of the
           symbolic ref were printed correctly, with status 1 if the
           requested name is not a symbolic ref, or 128 if another error
           occurs.
