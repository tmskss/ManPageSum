    LESSKEY(1)               General Commands Manual              LESSKEY(1)
## NAME         top
           lesskey - customize key bindings for less
## SYNOPSIS (deprecated)         top
           lesskey [-o output] [--] [input]
           lesskey [--output=output] [--] [input]
           lesskey -V
           lesskey --version
## SCOPE         top
           This document describes the format of the lesskey source file,
           which is used by less version 582 and later.  In previous
           versions of less, a separate program called lesskey was used to
           compile the lesskey source file into a format understood by less.
           This compilation step is no longer required and the lesskey
           program is therefore deprecated, although the file format remains
           supported by less itself.
## DESCRIPTION         top
           A lesskey file specifies a set of key bindings and environment
           variables to be used by subsequent invocations of less.
## FILE FORMAT         top
           The input file consists of one or more sections.  Each section
           starts with a line that identifies the type of section.  Possible
           sections are:
           #command
                  Customizes command key bindings.
           #line-edit
                  Customizes line-editing key bindings.
           #env   Defines environment variables.
           Blank lines and lines which start with a pound sign (#) are
           ignored, except as noted below.
## COMMAND SECTION         top
           The command section begins with the line
           #command
           If the command section is the first section in the file, this
           line may be omitted.  The command section consists of lines of
           the form:
                string <whitespace> action [extra-string] <newline>
           Whitespace is any sequence of one or more spaces and/or tabs.
           The string is the command key(s) which invoke the action.  The
           string may be a single command key, or a sequence of up to 15
           keys.  The action is the name of the less action, from the list
           below.  The characters in the string may appear literally, or be
           prefixed by a caret to indicate a control key.  A backslash
           followed by one to three octal digits may be used to specify a
           character by its octal value.  A backslash followed by certain
           characters specifies input characters as follows:
                \b   BACKSPACE   (0x08)
                \e   ESCAPE      (0x1B)
                \n   NEWLINE     (0x0A)
                \r   RETURN      (0x0D)
                \t   TAB         (0x09)
                \k followed by a single character represents the char(s)
                produced when one of these keys is pressed:
                \kb   BACKSPACE (the BACKSPACE key)
                \kB   ctrl-BACKSPACE
                \kd   DOWN ARROW
                \kD   PAGE DOWN
                \ke   END
                \kh   HOME
                \ki   INSERT
                \kl   LEFT ARROW
                \kL   ctrl-LEFT ARROW
                \kr   RIGHT ARROW
                \kR   ctrl-RIGHT ARROW
                \kt   BACKTAB
                \ku   UP ARROW
                \kU   PAGE UP
                \kx   DELETE
                \kX   ctrl-DELETE
                \k1   F1
                A backslash followed by any other character indicates that
                character is to be taken literally.  Characters which must
                be preceded by backslash include caret, space, tab and the
                backslash itself.
                An action may be followed by an "extra" string.  When such a
                command is entered while running less, the action is
                performed, and then the extra string is parsed, just as if
                it were typed in to less.  This feature can be used in
                certain cases to extend the functionality of a command.  For
                example, see the "{" and ":t" commands in the example below.
                The extra string has a special meaning for the "quit"
                action: when less quits, the first character of the extra
                string is used as its exit status.
## EXAMPLE         top
           The following input file describes the set of default command
           keys used by less.  Documentation on each command can be found in
           the man page, under the key sequence which invokes the command.

## PRECEDENCE         top
           Commands specified by lesskey take precedence over the default
           commands.  A default command key may be disabled by including it
           in the input file with the action "invalid".  Alternatively, a
           key may be defined to do nothing by using the action "noaction".
           "noaction" is similar to "invalid", but less will give an error
           beep for an "invalid" command, but not for a "noaction" command.
           In addition, ALL default commands may be disabled by adding this
           control line to the input file:
           #stop
           This will cause all default commands to be ignored.  The #stop
           line should be the last line in that section of the file.
           Be aware that #stop can be dangerous.  Since all default commands
           are disabled, you must provide sufficient commands before the
           #stop line to enable all necessary actions.  For example, failure
           to provide a "quit" command can lead to frustration.
## LINE EDITING SECTION         top
           The line-editing section begins with the line:
           #line-edit
           This section specifies new key bindings for the line editing
           commands, in a manner similar to the way key bindings for
           ordinary commands are specified in the #command section.  The
           line-editing section consists of a list of keys and actions, one
           per line as in the example below.
## EXAMPLE         top
           The following input file describes the set of default line-
           editing keys used by less:
                #line-edit
                \t           forw-complete
                \17          back-complete
                \e\t         back-complete
                ^L           expand
                ^V           literal
                ^A           literal
                \el          right
                \kr          right
                \eh          left
                \kl          left
                \eb          word-left
                \e\kl        word-left
                \ew          word-right
                \e\kr        word-right
                \ei          insert
                \ex          delete
                \kx          delete
                \eX          word-delete
                \ekx         word-delete
                \e\b         word-backspace
                \e0          home
                \kh          home
                \e$          end
                \ke          end
                \ek          up
                \ku          up
                \ej          down
                ^G           abort
## LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The environment variable section begins with the line
           #env
           Following this line is a list of environment variable
           assignments.  Each line consists of an environment variable name,
           an equals sign (=) and the value to be assigned to the
           environment variable.  White space before and after the equals
           sign is ignored.  Variables assigned in this way are visible only
           to less.  If a variable is specified in the system environment
           and also in a lesskey file, the value in the lesskey file takes
           precedence.
           If the variable name is followed by += rather than =, the string
           is appended to the variable's existing value.  This currently
           works only if any += lines immediately follow the same variable's
           original definition (with an = line), without any intervening
           definitions of other variables.  It can append only to a variable
           defined earlier in the file; it cannot append to a variable in
           the system environment.
## CONDITIONAL CONFIGURATION         top
           If a line begins with #version followed by a relational operator
           and a version number, the remainder of the line is parsed if and
           only if the running version of less (or lesskey) matches the
           operator.  This can be helpful if a lesskey file is used by
           different versions of less.
           For example, suppose that a new command named 'sideways-search'
           is added in less version 777.  Then the following line would
           assign the command to the Q key, but only in versions of less
           which support it. The line would be ignored by versions earlier
           than 777.
                     #version >= 777  Q sideways-search
           These six operators are supported:
                 >    Greater than
                 <    Less than

           The #version feature is not supported in less and lesskey before
           version 594.  In those older versions, all #version lines are
           ignored.
## EXAMPLE         top
           The following input file sets the -i and -S options when is run
           and, on version 595 and higher, adds a --color option.
              #env
              LESS = -i -S
              #version >= 595  LESS += --color=Hkc

## WARNINGS         top
           On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, certain keys send a sequence of
           characters which start with a NUL character (0).  This NUL
           character should be represented as \340 in a lesskey file.
