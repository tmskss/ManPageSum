## NAME         top
           find-filter - fine-grained file selection based on time
           attributes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/find-filter [-v?]  predicate
## DESCRIPTION         top
           find-filter is a filter for a list of file names read on standard
           input, and if the files match the predicate their names are
           written on standard output.
           The supported predicate forms are based on the file's creation
           time or modification time, and take the form ctime or mtime
           followed by a time specification.  A time specification takes the
           form of a + or - followed by days (a non-negative integer),
           optionally followed by a colon (:) and hours (an integer in the
           range 0 to 23), optionally followed by another colon (:) and
           minutes (an integer in the range 0 to 59).
           The semantics of the time specification are that a file matches
           the predicate if the chosen time attribute for the file is less
           than (+) the current time minus the time specification, else more
           than or equal to (-) the current time minus the time
           specification.  Alternatively, + means before the current time
           minus the time specification, and - means at or after the current
           time minus the time specification.
           find-filter is intended to be used to provide finer-grain and
           platform independent selection compared to the -mtime or -ctime
           options of find(1).  find-filter is expected to be used as a
           post-filter for the output from find(1), and this is how it is
           used in the pmlogger_daily(1) scripts to select files to be
           compressed or culled.
## EXAMPLES         top
           The following predicate examples illustrate some typical uses.
           mtime +3    Matches files modified more than 3 days ago.
           ctime -0:2  Matches files created in the last 2 hours.
           ctime +0:0:15
                       Matches files created more than 15 minutes ago.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           There are none, unless the -v option is used, in which case some
           diagnostics are written to standard error.
           Exit status is always zero, unless there are errors found when
           parsing the command line arguments.
