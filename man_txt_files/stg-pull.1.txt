## NAME         top
           stg-pull - Pull changes from a remote repository
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg pull [OPTIONS] [repository]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Pull the latest changes from a remote repository.
           The remote repository may be specified on the command line, but
           defaults to branch.<name>.remote from the git configuration, or
           "origin" if not configured.
           This command works by popping all currently applied patches from
           the stack, pulling the changes from the remote repository,
           updating the stack base to the new remote HEAD, and finally
           pushing all formerly applied patches back onto the stack. Merge
           conflicts may occur during the final push step. Those conflicts
           need to be resolved manually.
           See git-fetch(1) for the format of remote repository argument.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --nopush
               Do not push back patches after pulling
           -m, --merged
               Check for patches that may have been merged upstream.
               When pushing-back patches, each patch is checked to see if
               its changes already exist in the just-pulled upstream
               changes. If a patch’s changes have already been merged
               upstream, the patch will still exist in the stack, but become
               empty after the pull operation.
           --conflicts[=<policy>]
               Either "allow" or "disallow" pushing a patch with conflicts.
               Using --conflicts=allow (or just --conflicts) allows pushing
               a patch that may result in unresolved merge conflicts. The
               patch will be pushed and files with conflicts will be left
               with conflict markers to be resolved manually; or the
               operation undone with stg undo --hard. This is the default
               behavior and also corresponds to the
               "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" variable being set to "true".
               Using --conflicts=disallow disallows pushing any patch that
               would result in merge conflicts. The operation will stop on
               the last patch that can be pushed without conflicts. This
               behavior can be configured by setting
               "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" to "false".
