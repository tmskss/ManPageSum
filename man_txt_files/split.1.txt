## NAME         top
           split - split a file into pieces
## SYNOPSIS         top
           split [OPTION]... [FILE [PREFIX]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Output pieces of FILE to PREFIXaa, PREFIXab, ...; default size is
           1000 lines, and default PREFIX is 'x'.
           With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -a, --suffix-length=N
                  generate suffixes of length N (default 2)
           --additional-suffix=SUFFIX
                  append an additional SUFFIX to file names
           -b, --bytes=SIZE
                  put SIZE bytes per output file
           -C, --line-bytes=SIZE
                  put at most SIZE bytes of records per output file
           -d     use numeric suffixes starting at 0, not alphabetic
           --numeric-suffixes[=FROM]
                  same as -d, but allow setting the start value
           -x     use hex suffixes starting at 0, not alphabetic
           --hex-suffixes[=FROM]
                  same as -x, but allow setting the start value
           -e, --elide-empty-files
                  do not generate empty output files with '-n'
           --filter=COMMAND
                  write to shell COMMAND; file name is $FILE
           -l, --lines=NUMBER
                  put NUMBER lines/records per output file
           -n, --number=CHUNKS
                  generate CHUNKS output files; see explanation below
           -t, --separator=SEP
                  use SEP instead of newline as the record separator; '\0'
                  (zero) specifies the NUL character
           -u, --unbuffered
                  immediately copy input to output with '-n r/...'
           --verbose
                  print a diagnostic just before each output file is opened
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K
           is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y,R,Q (powers of 1024) or
           KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).  Binary prefixes can be used, too:
           KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.
       CHUNKS may be:
           N      split into N files based on size of input
           K/N    output Kth of N to stdout
           l/N    split into N files without splitting lines/records
           l/K/N  output Kth of N to stdout without splitting lines/records
           r/N    like 'l' but use round robin distribution
           r/K/N  likewise but only output Kth of N to stdout
