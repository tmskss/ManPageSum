    RANLIB(1)                 GNU Development Tools                RANLIB(1)
## NAME         top
           ranlib - generate an index to an archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ranlib [--plugin name] [-DhHvVt] archive
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and
           stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by
           a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file.
           You may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index.
           An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library
           and allows routines in the library to call each other without
           regard to their placement in the archive.
           The GNU ranlib program is another form of GNU ar; running ranlib
           is completely equivalent to executing ar -s.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h
           -H
           --help
               Show usage information for ranlib.
           -v
           -V
           --version
               Show the version number of ranlib.
           -D  Operate in deterministic mode.  The symbol map archive
               member's header will show zero for the UID, GID, and
               timestamp.  When this option is used, multiple runs will
               produce identical output files.
               If binutils was configured with
               --enable-deterministic-archives, then this mode is on by
               default.  It can be disabled with the -U option, described
               below.
           -t  Update the timestamp of the symbol map of an archive.
           -U  Do not operate in deterministic mode.  This is the inverse of
               the -D option, above: the archive index will get actual UID,
               GID, timestamp, and file mode values.
               If binutils was configured without
               --enable-deterministic-archives, then this mode is on by
               default.
           @file
               Read command-line options from file.  The options read are
               inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does
               not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
               literally, and not removed.
               Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
               character may be included in an option by surrounding the
               entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any
               character (including a backslash) may be included by
               prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The
               file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
               options will be processed recursively.
