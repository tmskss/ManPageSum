## NAME         top
           fincore - count pages of file contents in core
## SYNOPSIS         top
           fincore [options] file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           fincore counts pages of file contents being resident in memory
           (in core), and reports the numbers. If an error occurs during
           counting, then an error message is printed to the stderr and
           fincore continues processing the rest of files listed in a
           command line.
           The default output is subject to change. So whenever possible,
           you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts. Always
           explicitly define expected columns by using --output columns-list
           in environments where a stable output is required.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --noheadings
               Do not print a header line in status output.
           -b, --bytes
               Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable
               format.
               By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and
               unit prefixes are in power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of
               symbols are exhibited truncated in order to reach a better
               readability, by exhibiting alone the first letter of them;
               examples: "1 KiB" and "1 MiB" are respectively exhibited as
               "1 K" and "1 M", then omitting on purpose the mention "iB",
               which is part of these abbreviations.
           -o, --output list
               Define output columns. See the --help output to get a list of
               the currently supported columns. The default list of columns
               may be extended if list is specified in the format +list.
           -r, --raw
               Produce output in raw format. All potentially unsafe
               characters are hex-escaped (\x<code>).
           -J, --json
               Use JSON output format.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
