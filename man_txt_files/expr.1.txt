## NAME         top
           expr - evaluate expressions
## SYNOPSIS         top
           expr EXPRESSION
           expr OPTION
## DESCRIPTION         top
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           Print the value of EXPRESSION to standard output.  A blank line
           below separates increasing precedence groups.  EXPRESSION may be:
           ARG1 | ARG2
                  ARG1 if it is neither null nor 0, otherwise ARG2
           ARG1 & ARG2
                  ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0, otherwise 0
           ARG1 < ARG2
                  ARG1 is less than ARG2
           ARG1 <= ARG2
                  ARG1 is less than or equal to ARG2
           ARG1 = ARG2
                  ARG1 is equal to ARG2
           ARG1 != ARG2
                  ARG1 is unequal to ARG2
           ARG1 >= ARG2
                  ARG1 is greater than or equal to ARG2
           ARG1 > ARG2
                  ARG1 is greater than ARG2
           ARG1 + ARG2
                  arithmetic sum of ARG1 and ARG2
           ARG1 - ARG2
                  arithmetic difference of ARG1 and ARG2
           ARG1 * ARG2
                  arithmetic product of ARG1 and ARG2
           ARG1 / ARG2
                  arithmetic quotient of ARG1 divided by ARG2
           ARG1 % ARG2
                  arithmetic remainder of ARG1 divided by ARG2
           STRING : REGEXP
                  anchored pattern match of REGEXP in STRING
           match STRING REGEXP
                  same as STRING : REGEXP
           substr STRING POS LENGTH
                  substring of STRING, POS counted from 1
           index STRING CHARS
                  index in STRING where any CHARS is found, or 0
           length STRING
                  length of STRING
           + TOKEN
                  interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a
                  keyword like 'match' or an operator like '/'
           ( EXPRESSION )
                  value of EXPRESSION
           Beware that many operators need to be escaped or quoted for
           shells.  Comparisons are arithmetic if both ARGs are numbers,
           else lexicographical.  Pattern matches return the string matched
           between \( and \) or null; if \( and \) are not used, they return
           the number of characters matched or 0.
           Exit status is 0 if EXPRESSION is neither null nor 0, 1 if
           EXPRESSION is null or 0, 2 if EXPRESSION is syntactically
           invalid, and 3 if an error occurred.
