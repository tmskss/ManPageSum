    dpkg-realpath(1)               dpkg suite               dpkg-realpath(1)
## NAME         top
           dpkg-realpath - print the resolved pathname with DPKG_ROOT
           support
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dpkg-realpath [option...] pathname
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dpkg-realpath is a tool (since dpkg 1.20.1) to resolve a
           pathname, that takes the dpkg(1) root directory into account,
           either implicitly from the DPKG_ROOT environment variable or from
           the command-line --root or --instdir options, and returns an
           absolute pathname relative to the root directory.  The root
           directory must not be prefixed to the pathname to be resolved.
           This is intended to be used by other dpkg helpers, or by
           maintainer scripts instead of using realpath(1) or readlink(1) to
           canonicalize pathnames, as these latter commands do not support
           canonicalization relative to a different root than /.
## OPTIONS         top
           -z, --zero
               Use a NUL byte to end output lines instead of a new line
               character (since dpkg 1.20.6).
           --instdir directory
           --root directory
               Set the root directory to directory, which is the base
               directory that pathnames get canonicalized against.  Defaults
               to «/» if DPKG_ROOT has not been set.
           -?, --help
               Show the usage message and exit.
           --version
               Show the version and exit.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           DPKG_ROOT
               If set and the --instdir or --root options have not been
               specified, it will be used as the filesystem root directory.
           DPKG_COLORS
               Sets the color mode.  The currently accepted values are: auto
               (default), always and never.
## SEE ALSO         top
           realpath(1), readlink(1).
