## NAME         top
           pmdaperfevent - hardware performance counter performance metrics
           domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/pmdaperfevent [-d domain] [-l logfile]
           [-U username] [-i port] [-p] [-u socket] [-6]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdaperfevent is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) that
           configures and reads the hardware performance counters using the
           Linux kernel perf_event API.
           The perfevent PMDA exports metrics for hardware performance
           counters that are configurable from the Linux kernel perf_event
           API.  The PMDA uses the libpfm4 library to access the hardware
           performance counters so any counters that are supported in
           libpfm4 should be available.  Also included is the ability to
           read the Intel RAPL counters via direct MSR access.  The PMDA
           supports automatically loading different counters for each
           hardware architecture.  A single configuration file is used to
           specify the desired counters for each hardware performance
           monitoring unit (PMU).  The configuration file allows different
           counters to be programmed on different CPUs and supports round-
           robin assignment of uncore counters needed for some AMD chips.
           The PMDA also counts for events exposed in the kernel via
           /sys/bus/event_source/devices directory. The PMU device name and
           the event name must be mentioned in the configuration file.
           Otherwise, the metric won't be available to monitor through this
           PMDA.
           The PMDA configures the counters to count events in both user and
           kernel mode.  This means that the hardware counters are
           unavailable to use by normal unprivileged user applications when
           they are in use by the PMDA.  The PMDA provides a mechanism to
           temporarily disable the system-wide counters in order to allow
           normal users to be able to use the counters if they wish.  See
           perfalloc(1) for details.
           Note that pmdaperfevent is affected by the value of the
           kernel.perf_event_paranoid setting, which can be adjusted by
           sysctl(8).
           A brief description of the pmdaperfevent command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                perfevent.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdaperfevent is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If
                the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the privileged "root" account.
           -i   listen on given port number for connection from pmcd(1)
           -p   communicate with pmcd(1) via stdin/stdout
           -u   expect pmcd(1) to connect on given unix domain socket
           -6   expect pmcd(1) to connect on given ipv6 port (number or
                name)
## INSTALLATION         top
           The perfevent PMDA is not activated by default To install the
           PMDA, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent
                # ./Remove
           pmdaperfevent is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

## UPGRADING         top
           Some metric names have changed starting in version 3.10.8 to
           better conform to PMNS conventions.  pmlogrewrite(1) can be used
           to update old archives.  A helper utility,
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perfevent-makerewrite.pl will generate a
           config file that is suitable for use with pmlogrewrite(1) to
           update the metric names in existing archives.
## BUGS         top
           Each event is placed in its own group and there is no way to
           group related events together so they are guaranteed to be
           simultaneously active.  A workaround for this is to ensure that
           the number of configured events is less than or equal to the
           number of available hardware counters.  This means that the
           events will not be time-multiplexed by the kernel and will be
           simultaneously active.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
