## NAME         top
           systemd-socket-activate - Test socket activation of daemons
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-socket-activate [OPTIONS...] daemon [OPTIONS...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           systemd-socket-activate may be used to launch a socket-activated
           service program from the command line for testing purposes. It
           may also be used to launch individual instances of the service
           program per connection.
           The daemon to launch and its options should be specified after
           options intended for systemd-socket-activate.
           If the --inetd option is given, the socket file descriptor will
           be used as the standard input and output of the launched process.
           Otherwise, standard input and output will be inherited, and
           sockets will be passed through file descriptors 3 and higher.
           Sockets passed through $LISTEN_FDS to systemd-socket-activate
           will be passed through to the daemon, in the original positions.
           Other sockets specified with --listen= will use consecutive
           descriptors. By default, systemd-socket-activate listens on a
           stream socket, use --datagram and --seqpacket to listen on
           datagram or sequential packet sockets instead (see below).
## OPTIONS         top
           -l address, --listen=address
               Listen on this address. Takes a string like "2000" or
               "127.0.0.1:2001".
           -a, --accept
               Launch an instance of the service program for each connection
               and pass the connection socket.
           -d, --datagram
               Listen on a datagram socket (SOCK_DGRAM), instead of a stream
               socket (SOCK_STREAM). May not be combined with --seqpacket.
           --seqpacket
               Listen on a sequential packet socket (SOCK_SEQPACKET),
               instead of a stream socket (SOCK_STREAM). May not be combined
               with --datagram.
           --inetd
               Use the inetd protocol for passing file descriptors, i.e. as
               standard input and standard output, instead of the new-style
               protocol for passing file descriptors using $LISTEN_FDS (see
               above).
           -E VAR[=VALUE], --setenv=VAR[=VALUE]
               Add this variable to the environment of the launched process.
               If VAR is followed by "=", assume that it is a variable–value
               pair. Otherwise, obtain the value from the environment of
               systemd-socket-activate itself.
           --fdname=NAME[:NAME...]
               Specify names for the file descriptors passed. This is
               equivalent to setting FileDescriptorName= in socket unit
               files, and enables use of sd_listen_fds_with_names(3).
               Multiple entries may be specifies using separate options or
               by separating names with colons (":") in one option. In case
               more names are given than descriptors, superfluous ones will
               be ignored. In case less names are given than descriptors,
               the remaining file descriptors will be unnamed.
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           $LISTEN_FDS, $LISTEN_PID, $LISTEN_FDNAMES
               See sd_listen_fds(3).
           $SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET, $SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL, $SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME,
           $SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR, $SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION
               Same as in systemd(1).
## EXAMPLES         top
           Example 1. Run an echo server on port 2000
               $ systemd-socket-activate -l 2000 --inetd -a cat
           Example 2. Run a socket-activated instance of systemd-journal-
           gatewayd(8)
               $ systemd-socket-activate -l 19531 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-journal-gatewayd
