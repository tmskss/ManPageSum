           at LOCATION.
           The format of the bundle file is that generated by build-bundle.

           The following options are understood:

               Show help options and exit.
           -v, --verbose

               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
           --ref=REF
               Override the ref specified in the bundle.
           --oci

               you want to do multiple repo operations before finally
               updating the summary.
