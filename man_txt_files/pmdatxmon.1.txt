## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdatxmon is an example Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
           which exports a small number of performance metrics from a
           simulated transaction monitor.
           The txmon PMDA is shipped as both binary and source code and is
           designed to be an aid for PMDA developers; the txmon PMDA
           demonstrates how performance data can be exported from an
           application (in this case txrecord) to the PCP infrastructure via
           a shared memory segment.  As a matter of convenience, pmdatxmon
           creates (and destroys on exit) the shared memory segment.
           The tx_type arguments are arbitrary unique tags used to identify
           different transaction types.
           The txrecord application simulates the processing of one or more
           transactions identified by tx_type and with an observed service
           time of servtime .
           With the -l option, txrecord displays the current summary of the
           transaction activity from the shared memory segment.
           genload is a shell and awk(1) script that acts as a front-end to
           txrecord to generate a constant load of simulated transaction
           activity.
           A brief description of the pmdatxmon command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                txmon.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdatxmon is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
                log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           txmon performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon
                # ./Install
           You will be prompted for the tx_type tags.
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon
                # ./Remove
           pmdatxmon is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH
                  command line options used to launch pmdatxmon
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon/help
                  default help text file for the txmon metrics
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon/Install
                  installation script for the pmdatxmon agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon/Remove
                  undo installation script for the pmdatxmon agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/txmon.log
                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdatxmon
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
