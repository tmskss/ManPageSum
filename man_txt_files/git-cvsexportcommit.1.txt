## NAME         top
           git-cvsexportcommit - Export a single commit to a CVS checkout
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git cvsexportcommit [-h] [-u] [-v] [-c] [-P] [-p] [-a] [-d <cvsroot>]
                   [-w <cvs-workdir>] [-W] [-f] [-m <msgprefix>] [<parent-commit>] <commit-id>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Exports a commit from Git to a CVS checkout, making it easier to
           merge patches from a Git repository into a CVS repository.
           Specify the name of a CVS checkout using the -w switch or execute
           it from the root of the CVS working copy. In the latter case
           GIT_DIR must be defined. See examples below.
           It does its best to do the safe thing, it will check that the
           files are unchanged and up to date in the CVS checkout, and it
           will not autocommit by default.
           Supports file additions, removals, and commits that affect binary
           files.
           If the commit is a merge commit, you must tell git
           cvsexportcommit what parent the changeset should be done against.
## OPTIONS         top
           -c
               Commit automatically if the patch applied cleanly. It will
               not commit if any hunks fail to apply or there were other
               problems.
           -p
               Be pedantic (paranoid) when applying patches. Invokes patch
               with --fuzz=0
           -a
               Add authorship information. Adds Author line, and Committer
               (if different from Author) to the message.
           -d
               Set an alternative CVSROOT to use. This corresponds to the
               CVS -d parameter. Usually users will not want to set this,
               except if using CVS in an asymmetric fashion.
           -f
               Force the merge even if the files are not up to date.
           -P
               Force the parent commit, even if it is not a direct parent.
           -m
               Prepend the commit message with the provided prefix. Useful
               for patch series and the like.
           -u
               Update affected files from CVS repository before attempting
               export.
           -k
               Reverse CVS keyword expansion (e.g. $Revision: 1.2.3.4$
               becomes $Revision$) in working CVS checkout before applying
               patch.
           -w
               Specify the location of the CVS checkout to use for the
               export. This option does not require GIT_DIR to be set before
               execution if the current directory is within a Git
               repository. The default is the value of
               cvsexportcommit.cvsdir.
           -W
               Tell cvsexportcommit that the current working directory is
               not only a Git checkout, but also the CVS checkout.
               Therefore, Git will reset the working directory to the parent
               commit before proceeding.
           -v
               Verbose.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           cvsexportcommit.cvsdir
               The default location of the CVS checkout to use for the
               export.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Merge one patch into CVS
                   $ export GIT_DIR=~/project/.git
                   $ cd ~/project_cvs_checkout
                   $ git cvsexportcommit -v <commit-sha1>
                   $ cvs commit -F .msg <files>
           Merge one patch into CVS (-c and -w options). The working
           directory is within the Git Repo
                           $ git cvsexportcommit -v -c -w ~/project_cvs_checkout <commit-sha1>
           Merge pending patches into CVS automatically — only if you really
           know what you are doing
                   $ export GIT_DIR=~/project/.git
                   $ cd ~/project_cvs_checkout
                   $ git cherry cvshead myhead | sed -n 's/^+ //p' | xargs -l1 git cvsexportcommit -c -p -v
