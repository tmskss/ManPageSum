## NAME         top
           rename - rename files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           rename [options] expression replacement file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           rename will rename the specified files by replacing the first
           occurrence of expression in their name by replacement.
## OPTIONS         top
           -s, --symlink
               Do not rename a symlink but change where it points.
           -v, --verbose
               Show which files were renamed, if any.
           -n, --no-act
               Do not make any changes; add --verbose to see what would be
               made.
           -a, --all
               Replace all occurrences of expression rather than only the
               first one.
           -l, --last
               Replace the last occurrence of expression rather than the
               first one.
           -o, --no-overwrite
               Do not overwrite existing files. When --symlink is active, do
               not overwrite symlinks pointing to existing targets.
           -i, --interactive
               Ask before overwriting existing files.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## WARNING         top
           The renaming has no safeguards by default or without any one of
           the options --no-overwrite, --interactive or --no-act. If the
           user has permission to rewrite file names, the command will
           perform the action without any questions. For example, the result
           can be quite drastic when the command is run as root in the /lib
           directory. Always make a backup before running the command,
           unless you truly know what you are doing.
## EDGE CASES         top
           If the expression is empty, then by default replacement will be
           added to the start of the filename. With --all, replacement will
           be inserted in between every two characters of the filename, as
           well as at the start and end.
           Normally, only the final path component of a filename is updated.
           (Or with --symlink, only the final path component of the link.)
           But if either expression or replacement contains a /, the full
           path is updated. This can cause a file to be moved between
           folders. Creating folders, and moving files between filesystems,
           is not supported.
## INTERACTIVE MODE         top
           As most standard utilities rename can be used with a terminal
           device (tty in short) in canonical mode, where the line is
           buffered by the tty and you press ENTER to validate the user
           input. If you put your tty in cbreak mode however, rename
           requires only a single key press to answer the prompt. To set
           cbreak mode, run for example:
               sh -c 'stty -icanon min 1; "$0" "$@"; stty icanon' rename -i from to files
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0
               all requested rename operations were successful
           1
               all rename operations failed
           2
               some rename operations failed
           4
               nothing was renamed
           64
               unanticipated error occurred
## EXAMPLES         top
           Given the files foo1, ..., foo9, foo10, ..., foo278, the commands
               rename foo foo00 foo?
               rename foo foo0 foo??
           will turn them into foo001, ..., foo009, foo010, ..., foo278. And
               rename .htm .html *.htm
           will fix the extension of your html files. Provide an empty
           string for shortening:
               rename '_with_long_name' '' file_with_long_name.*
           will remove the substring in the filenames.
