## NAME         top
           systemd-delta - Find overridden configuration files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-delta [OPTIONS...] [PREFIX[/SUFFIX]|SUFFIX...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           systemd-delta may be used to identify and compare configuration
           files that override other configuration files. Files in /etc/
           have highest priority, files in /run/ have the second highest
           priority, ..., files in /usr/lib/ have lowest priority. Files in
           a directory with higher priority override files with the same
           name in directories of lower priority. In addition, certain
           configuration files can have ".d" directories which contain
           "drop-in" files with configuration snippets which augment the
           main configuration file. "Drop-in" files can be overridden in the
           same way by placing files with the same name in a directory of
           higher priority (except that, in case of "drop-in" files, both
           the "drop-in" file name and the name of the containing directory,
           which corresponds to the name of the main configuration file,
           must match). For a fuller explanation, see systemd.unit(5).
           The command line argument will be split into a prefix and a
           suffix. Either is optional. The prefix must be one of the
           directories containing configuration files (/etc/, /run/,
           /usr/lib/, ...). If it is given, only overriding files contained
           in this directory will be shown. Otherwise, all overriding files
           will be shown. The suffix must be a name of a subdirectory
           containing configuration files like tmpfiles.d, sysctl.d or
           systemd/system. If it is given, only configuration files in this
           subdirectory (across all configuration paths) will be analyzed.
           Otherwise, all configuration files will be analyzed. If the
           command line argument is not given at all, all configuration
           files will be analyzed. See below for some examples.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -t, --type=
               When listing the differences, only list those that are asked
               for. The list itself is a comma-separated list of desired
               difference types.
               Recognized types are:
               masked
                   Show masked files
               equivalent
                   Show overridden files that while overridden, do not
                   differ in content.
               redirected
                   Show files that are redirected to another.
               overridden
                   Show overridden, and changed files.
               extended
                   Show *.conf files in drop-in directories for units.
               unchanged
                   Show unmodified files too.
           --diff=
               When showing modified files, when a file is overridden show a
               diff as well. This option takes a boolean argument. If
               omitted, it defaults to true.
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
           --no-pager
               Do not pipe output into a pager.
## EXAMPLES         top
           To see all local configuration:
               systemd-delta
           To see all runtime configuration:
               systemd-delta /run
           To see all system unit configuration changes:
               systemd-delta systemd/system
           To see all runtime "drop-in" changes for system units:
               systemd-delta --type=extended /run/systemd/system
## EXIT STATUS         top
           On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
