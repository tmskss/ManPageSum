## NAME         top
           tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and
           files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.
           -a, --append
                  append to the given FILEs, do not overwrite
           -i, --ignore-interrupts
                  ignore interrupt signals
           -p     operate in a more appropriate MODE with pipes.
           --output-error[=MODE]
                  set behavior on write error.  See MODE below
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
       MODE determines behavior with write errors on the outputs:
           warn   diagnose errors writing to any output
           warn-nopipe
                  diagnose errors writing to any output not a pipe
           exit   exit on error writing to any output
           exit-nopipe
                  exit on error writing to any output not a pipe
           The default MODE for the -p option is 'warn-nopipe'.  With
           "nopipe" MODEs, exit immediately if all outputs become broken
           pipes.  The default operation when --output-error is not
           specified, is to exit immediately on error writing to a pipe, and
           diagnose errors writing to non pipe outputs.
