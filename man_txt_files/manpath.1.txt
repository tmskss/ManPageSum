    MANPATH(1)                 Manual pager utils                 MANPATH(1)
## NAME         top
           manpath - determine search path for manual pages
## SYNOPSIS         top
           manpath [-qgdc?V] [-m system[,...]] [-C file]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           If $MANPATH is set, manpath will simply display its contents and
           issue a warning.  If not, manpath will determine a suitable
           manual page hierarchy search path and display the results.
           The colon-delimited path is determined using information gained
           from the man-db configuration file – (/usr/local/etc/man_db.conf)
           and the user's environment.
## OPTIONS         top
           -q, --quiet
                  Do not issue warnings.
           -d, --debug
                  Print debugging information.
           -c, --catpath
                  Produce a catpath as opposed to a manpath.  Once the
                  manpath is determined, each path element is converted to
                  its relative catpath.
           -g, --global
                  Produce a manpath consisting of all paths named as
                  "global" within the man-db configuration file.
           -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
                  If this system has access to other operating systems'
                  manual hierarchies, this option can be used to include
                  them in the output of manpath.  To include NewOS's manual
                  page hierarchies use the option -m NewOS.
                  The system specified can be a combination of comma
                  delimited operating system names.  To include the native
                  operating system's manual page hierarchies, the system
                  name man must be included in the argument string.  This
                  option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.
           -C file, --config-file=file
                  Use this user configuration file rather than the default
                  of ~/.manpath.
           -?, --help
                  Print a help message and exit.
           --usage
                  Print a short usage message and exit.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           MANPATH
                  If $MANPATH is set, manpath displays its value rather than
                  determining it on the fly.
                  See the SEARCH PATH section of manpath(5) for the default
                  behaviour and details of how this environment variable is
                  handled.
           SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it
                  had been specified as the argument to the -m option.
## FILES         top
           /usr/local/etc/man_db.conf
                  man-db configuration file.
