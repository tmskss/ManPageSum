## NAME         top
           systemd-tty-ask-password-agent - List or process pending systemd
           password requests
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-tty-ask-password-agent [OPTIONS...] [VARIABLE=VALUE...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           systemd-tty-ask-password-agent is a password agent that handles
           password requests of the system, for example for hard disk
           encryption passwords or SSL certificate passwords that need to be
           queried at boot-time or during runtime.
           systemd-tty-ask-password-agent implements the Password Agents
           Specification[1], and is one of many possible response agents
           which answer to queries formulated with systemd-ask-password(1).

           --list
               Lists all currently pending system password requests.
           --query
               Process all currently pending system password requests by
               querying the user on the calling TTY.
           --watch
               Continuously process password requests.
           --wall
               Forward password requests to wall(1) instead of querying the
               user on the calling TTY.
           --plymouth
               Ask question with plymouth(8) instead of querying the user on
               the calling TTY.
           --console[=DEVICE]
               Ask question on TTY DEVICE instead of querying the user on
               the calling TTY. If DEVICE is not specified, /dev/console
               will be used.
