## NAME         top
           guards - select from a list of files guarded by conditions
## SYNOPSIS         top
           guards [--prefix=dir] [--path=dir1:dir2:...] [--default=<0|1>]
           [--check|--list] [--invert-match] [--with-guards]
           [--config=<file>] symbol ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The script reads a configuration file that may contain so-called
           guards, file names, and comments, and writes those file names
           that satisfy all guards to standard output. The script takes a
           list of symbols as its arguments. Each line in the configuration
           file is processed separately. Lines may start with a number of
           guards. The following guards are defined:
               +xxx Include the file(s) on this line if the symbol xxx is
               defined.
               -xxx Exclude the file(s) on this line if the symbol xxx is
               defined.
               +!xxx Include the file(s) on this line if the symbol xxx is
               not defined.
               -!xxx Exclude the file(s) on this line if the symbol xxx is
               not defined.
               - Exclude this file. Used to avoid spurious --check messages.
           The guards are processed left to right. The last guard that
           matches determines if the file is included. If no guard is
           specified, the --default setting determines if the file is
           included.
           If no configuration file is specified, the script reads from
           standard input.
           The --check option is used to compare the specification file
           against the file system. If files are referenced in the
           specification that do not exist, or if files are not enlisted in
           the specification file warnings are printed. The --path option
           can be used to specify which directory or directories to scan.
           Multiple directories are separated by a colon (":") character.
           The --prefix option specifies the location of the files.
           Alternatively, the --path=@<file> syntax can be used to specify a
           file from which the file names will be read.
           Use --list to list all files independent of any rules. Use
           --invert-match to list only the excluded patches. Use
           --with-guards to also include all inclusion and exclusion rules.
