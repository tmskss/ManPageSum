    STG-LOG(1)                    StGit Manual                    STG-LOG(1)
## NAME         top
           stg-log - Display or optionally clear the stack changelog
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg log [OPTIONS] [--] [patch]...
           stg log --clear
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Show the history of changes to the stack. If one or more patch
           names are given, only the changes affecting those patches are
           shown.
           The stg-undo(1) and stg-redo(1) commands may be used to step back
           and forth through historical stack states. The stg-reset(1)
           command may be used to reset the stack directly to a historic
           state.
           The --clear option may be used to delete the stack’s change
           history. Undo and redo are unavailable on a stack without change
           history. Clearing the stack state history cannot be undone.
