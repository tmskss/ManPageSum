## NAME         top
           flatpak-config - Manage configuration
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak config [OPTION...]
           flatpak config [OPTION...] --set KEY VALUE
           flatpak config [OPTION...] --unset|--get KEY
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The flatpak config command shows or modifies the configuration of
           a flatpak installation. The following keys are supported:
           languages
               The languages that are included when installing Locale
               extensions. The value is a semicolon-separated list of
               two-letter language codes, or one of the special values * or
               all. If this key is unset, flatpak defaults to including the
               extra-languages key and the current locale.
           extra-languages
               This key is used when languages is not set, and it defines
               extra locale extensions on top of the system configured
               languages. The value is a semicolon-separated list of locale
               identifiers (language, optional locale, optional codeset,
               optional modifier) as documented by setlocale(3) (for
               example, en;en_DK;zh_HK.big5hkscs;uz_UZ.utf8@cyrillic).
           For configuration of individual remotes, see
           flatpak-remote-modify(1). For configuration of individual
           applications, see flatpak-override(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           --list
               Print all keys and their values.
           --set
               Set key KEY to VALUE.
           --unset
               Unset key KEY.
           --get
               Print value of KEY.
           -u, --user
               Configure per-user installation.
           --system
               Configure system-wide installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Configure the system-wide installation specified by NAME
               among those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
## EXAMPLES         top
           $ flatpak config --set languages "sv;en;fi"
