    GIT-MV(1)                      Git Manual                      GIT-MV(1)
## NAME         top
           git-mv - Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git mv [<options>] <source>... <destination>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Move or rename a file, directory or symlink.
               git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] <source> <destination>
               git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] <source> ... <destination directory>
           In the first form, it renames <source>, which must exist and be
           either a file, symlink or directory, to <destination>. In the
           second form, the last argument has to be an existing directory;
           the given sources will be moved into this directory.
           The index is updated after successful completion, but the change
           must still be committed.
## OPTIONS         top
           -f, --force
               Force renaming or moving of a file even if the <destination>
               exists.
           -k
               Skip move or rename actions which would lead to an error
               condition. An error happens when a source is neither existing
               nor controlled by Git, or when it would overwrite an existing
               file unless -f is given.
           -n, --dry-run
               Do nothing; only show what would happen
           -v, --verbose
               Report the names of files as they are moved.
## SUBMODULES         top
           Moving a submodule using a gitfile (which means they were cloned
           with a Git version 1.7.8 or newer) will update the gitfile and
           core.worktree setting to make the submodule work in the new
           location. It also will attempt to update the
           submodule.<name>.path setting in the gitmodules(5) file and stage
           that file (unless -n is used).
## BUGS         top
           Each time a superproject update moves a populated submodule (e.g.
           when switching between commits before and after the move) a stale
           submodule checkout will remain in the old location and an empty
           directory will appear in the new location. To populate the
           submodule again in the new location the user will have to run
           "git submodule update" afterwards. Removing the old directory is
           only safe when it uses a gitfile, as otherwise the history of the
           submodule will be deleted too. Both steps will be obsolete when
           recursive submodule update has been implemented.
