## NAME         top
           git-count-objects - Count unpacked number of objects and their
           disk consumption
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git count-objects [-v] [-H | --human-readable]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This counts the number of unpacked object files and disk space
           consumed by them, to help you decide when it is a good time to
           repack.
## OPTIONS         top
           -v, --verbose
               Report in more detail:
               count: the number of loose objects
               size: disk space consumed by loose objects, in KiB (unless -H
               is specified)
               in-pack: the number of in-pack objects
               size-pack: disk space consumed by the packs, in KiB (unless
               -H is specified)
               prune-packable: the number of loose objects that are also
               present in the packs. These objects could be pruned using git
               prune-packed.
               garbage: the number of files in object database that are
               neither valid loose objects nor valid packs
               size-garbage: disk space consumed by garbage files, in KiB
               (unless -H is specified)
               alternate: absolute path of alternate object databases; may
               appear multiple times, one line per path. Note that if the
               path contains non-printable characters, it may be surrounded
               by double-quotes and contain C-style backslashed escape
               sequences.
           -H, --human-readable
               Print sizes in human readable format
