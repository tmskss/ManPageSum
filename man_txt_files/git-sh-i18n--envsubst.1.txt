## NAME         top
           git-sh-i18n--envsubst - Git's own envsubst(1) for i18n fallbacks
## SYNOPSIS         top
           eval_gettext () {
                   printf "%s" "$1" | (
                           export PATH $(git sh-i18n--envsubst --variables "$1");
                           git sh-i18n--envsubst "$1"
                   )
           }
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
           documentation is meant for people who are studying the plumbing
           scripts and/or are writing new ones.
           git sh-i18n--envsubst is Git’s stripped-down copy of the GNU
           envsubst(1) program that comes with the GNU gettext package. It’s
           used internally by git-sh-i18n(1) to interpolate the variables
           passed to the eval_gettext function.
           No promises are made about the interface, or that this program
           won’t disappear without warning in the next version of Git. Don’t
           use it.
