## NAME         top
           pmdagluster - Gluster Filesystem PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdagluster is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values about mounted gluster filesystems using the
           gluster(8) command.  This PMDA exports metrics about volumes and
           bricks both local and remote to the node where pmdagluster is
           running.
           The gluster filesystem supports fine-grained control over
           enabling statistics on individual volumes, so that the values are
           optionally enabled or disabled on systems where they are not
           desired to be monitored.
           The pmstore(1) command can be used to enable and disable
           profiling of volumes.  Using the individual instances of the
           gluster.volume.profile metric, one can set their values (and
           associated profiling) either on (1) or off (0).  Additionally,
           pminfo(1) can report on the current status of profiling of each
           volume.
                # pminfo ‐f gluster.volume.profile
                gluster.volume.profile
                    inst [0 or "gv0"] value 0
                    inst [1 or "gv1"] value 1
                # pmstore ‐i "gv0" gluster.volume.profile 1
                gluster.volume.profile inst [0 or "gv0"] old value=0 new value=1
           Further details on the gluster filesystem can be found at
           http://www.gluster.org .
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install the gluster PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gluster
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gluster
               # ./Remove
           pmdagluster is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
