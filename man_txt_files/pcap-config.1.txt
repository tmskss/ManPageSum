## NAME         top
           pcap-config - write libpcap compiler and linker flags to standard
           output
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcap-config [ --static ] [ --cflags | --libs | --additional-libs
           ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           When run with the --cflags option, pcap-config writes to the
           standard output the -I compiler flags required to include
           libpcap's header files.  When run with the --libs option, pcap-
           config writes to the standard output the -L and -l linker flags
           required to link with libpcap, including -l flags for libraries
           required by libpcap.  When run with the --additional-libs option,
           pcap-config writes to the standard output the -L and -l flags for
           libraries required by libpcap, but not the -lpcap flag to link
           with libpcap itself.
           By default, it writes flags appropriate for compiling with a
           dynamically-linked version of libpcap; the --static flag causes
           it to write flags appropriate for compiling with a statically-
           linked version of libpcap.
