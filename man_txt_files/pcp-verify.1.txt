## NAME         top
           pcp-verify - verify aspects of a PCP installation
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp verify [-a archive] [-h host] [-csvV?]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-verify inspects various aspects of a PCP collector
           installation and reports on whether it is configured correctly
           for certain modes of operation.
           By default, pcp-verify checks that PMCD is running and no agents
           are in a failed state.  These checks can be extended and refined
           using the command line options.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a archive, --archive=archive
                Use the archive for verification.
           -c, --containers
                Verify the collector installation for monitoring containers.
           -h host, --host=host
                Connect to the PMCD on host for verification.
           -s, --secure
                Verify that the required components for encrypted
                communication are in place.
           -v, --verbose
                Increase the verbosity, and report on each check as it is
                made.  In the absence of any issues found, pcp-verify
                operates silently.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           pcp-verify will exit with a non-zero status if it finds anything
           worth reporting, otherwise it is silent and returns zero.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
