    MRTG2PCP(1)              General Commands Manual             MRTG2PCP(1)
## NAME         top
           mrtg2pcp - import MRTG data and create a PCP archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           mrtg2pcp hostname devname timezone infile outfile
## DESCRIPTION         top
           mrtg2pcp is intended to read an MRTG log file as created by
           mrtg(1) and translate this into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
           archive with the basename outfile.  The hostname, devname, and
           timezone arguments specify information about the system for which
           the statistics were gathered.
           The resultant PCP achive may be used with all PCP client tools to
           graph subsets of the data using pmchart(1), perform data
           reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
           pmie(1), etc.
           A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
           outfile.  These are outfile.0 (the performance data),
           outfile.meta (the metadata that describes the performance data)
           and outfile.index (a temporal index to improve efficiency of
           replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
           already, then mrtg2pcp will not overwrite them and will exit with
           an error message of the form
           __pmLogNewFile: ``blah.0'' already exists, not over-written
           mrtg2pcp is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
           wrapper around the PCP libpcp_import library, and as such could
           be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
           of performance data and create PCP archives.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
           mrtg(1), pmchart(1), pmie(1), pmlogger(1), LOGIMPORT(3) and
           PCP::LogImport(3).
