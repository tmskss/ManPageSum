## NAME         top
           diff3 - compare three files line by line
## SYNOPSIS         top
           diff3 [OPTION]... MYFILE OLDFILE YOURFILE
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Compare three files line by line.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -A, --show-all
                  output all changes, bracketing conflicts
           -e, --ed
                  output ed script incorporating changes from OLDFILE to
                  YOURFILE into MYFILE
           -E, --show-overlap
                  like -e, but bracket conflicts
           -3, --easy-only
                  like -e, but incorporate only nonoverlapping changes
           -x, --overlap-only
                  like -e, but incorporate only overlapping changes
           -X     like -x, but bracket conflicts
           -i     append 'w' and 'q' commands to ed scripts
           -m, --merge
                  output actual merged file, according to -A if no other
                  options are given
           -a, --text
                  treat all files as text
           --strip-trailing-cr
                  strip trailing carriage return on input
           -T, --initial-tab
                  make tabs line up by prepending a tab
           --diff-program=PROGRAM
                  use PROGRAM to compare files
           -L, --label=LABEL
                  use LABEL instead of file name (can be repeated up to
                  three times)
           --help display this help and exit
           -v, --version
                  output version information and exit
           The default output format is a somewhat human-readable
           representation of the changes.
           The -e, -E, -x, -X (and corresponding long) options cause an ed
           script to be output instead of the default.
           Finally, the -m (--merge) option causes diff3 to do the merge
           internally and output the actual merged file.  For unusual input,
           this is more robust than using ed.
           If a FILE is '-', read standard input.  Exit status is 0 if
           successful, 1 if conflicts, 2 if trouble.

           The full documentation for diff3 is maintained as a Texinfo
           manual.  If the info and diff3 programs are properly installed at
           your site, the command
                  info diff3
           should give you access to the complete manual.
