## NAME         top
           dpkg-genbuildinfo - generate Debian .buildinfo files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dpkg-genbuildinfo [option...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dpkg-genbuildinfo reads information from an unpacked and built
           Debian source tree and from the files it has generated and
           generates a Debian control file describing the build environment
           and the build artifacts (.buildinfo file).
           This command was introduced in dpkg 1.18.11.
## OPTIONS         top
           --build=type
               Specifies the build type from a comma-separated list of
               components.
               The allowed values are:
               any Generate build information including unqualified build
                   dependencies (Build-Depends) and architecture specific
                   build dependencies (Build-Depends-Arch).
               all Generate build information including unqualified build
                   dependencies (Build-Depends) and architecture independent
                   build dependencies (Build-Depends-Indep).
               source
                   Effectively ignored; generate build information with just
                   the unqualified build dependencies (Build-Depends).
               binary
                   Generate build information with all three types of build
                   dependencies.  This is an alias for any,all.
               full
                   Generate build information with all three types of build
                   dependencies.  This is an alias for any,all,source, and
                   the same as the default case when no build option is
                   specified.
           -ccontrolfile
               Specifies the main source control file to read information
               from. The default is debian/control.
           -lchangelog-file
               Specifies the changelog file to read information from. The
               default is debian/changelog.
           -ffiles-list-file
               Specifies where is the list of files that have been produced
               by the build, rather than using debian/files.
           -Fchangelog-format
               Specifies the format of the changelog. See
               dpkg-parsechangelog(1) for information about alternative
               formats.
           -O[filename]
               Print the buildinfo file to standard output (or filename if
               specified) rather than to dir/source-name_binary-
               version_arch.buildinfo (where dir is .. by default or upload-
               files-dir if -u was used).
           -uupload-files-dir
               Look for the files to be uploaded in upload-files-dir rather
               than ..  (dpkg-genbuildinfo needs to find these files so that
               it can include their sizes and checksums in the .buildinfo
               file).
           --always-include-kernel
               By default, the Build-Kernel-Version field will not be
               written out.
               Specify this option (since dpkg 1.19.0) to always write a
               Build-Kernel-Version field when generating the .buildinfo.
           --always-include-path
               By default, the Build-Path field will only be written if the
               current directory starts with an allowed pattern.
               On Debian and derivatives the pattern matches on /build/ at
               the start of the pathname.
               Specify this option to always write a Build-Path field when
               generating the .buildinfo.
           --admindir=dir
               Change the location of the dpkg database. The default
               location is /var/lib/dpkg.
           -q  dpkg-genbuildinfo might produce informative messages on
               standard error.  -q suppresses these messages.
           -?, --help
               Show the usage message and exit.
           --version
               Show the version and exit.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
               This variable can be used to enable or disable various
               features that affect the information included in the
               .buildinfo file, via the buildinfo option (since dpkg
               1.18.19).  This option contains a comma-separated list of
               features, prefixed with the ‘+’ or ‘-’ modifiers, to denote
               whether to enable or disable them.  The special feature “all”
               can be used to enable or disable all other features.  The
               feature “path” controls whether to unconditionally include
               the Build-Path field.
           DPKG_COLORS
               Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
               accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.
           DPKG_NLS
               If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
               Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
               i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are:
               0 and 1 (default).
## FILES         top
           debian/files
               The list of generated files.  dpkg-genbuildinfo reads the
               data here when producing a .buildinfo file.
