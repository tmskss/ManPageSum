## NAME         top
           systemd-ac-power - Report whether we are connected to an external
           power source
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-ac-power [OPTIONS...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           systemd-ac-power may be used to check whether the system is
           running on AC power or not. By default it will simply return
           success (if we can detect that we are running on AC power) or
           failure, with no output. This can be useful for example to debug
           ConditionACPower= (see systemd.unit(5)).
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -v, --verbose
               Show result as text instead of just returning success or
               failure.
           --low
               Instead of showing AC power state, show low battery state. In
               this case will return zero if all batteries are currently
               discharging and below 5% of maximum charge. Returns non-zero
               otherwise.
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           On success (running on AC power), 0 is returned, a non-zero
           failure code otherwise.
