## NAME         top
           ldapurl - LDAP URL formatting tool
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ldapurl [-a attrs] [-b searchbase] [-e [!]ext[=extparam]]
           [-E [!]ext[=extparam]] [-f filter] [-H ldapuri] [-h ldaphost]
           [-p ldapport] [-s {base|one|sub|children}] [-S scheme]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ldapurl is a command that allows one to either compose or
           decompose LDAP URIs.
           When invoked with the -H option, ldapurl extracts the components
           of the ldapuri option argument, unescaping hex-escaped chars as
           required.  It basically acts as a frontend to the
           ldap_url_parse(3) call.  Otherwise, it builds an LDAP URI based
           on the components passed with the appropriate options, performing
           the inverse operation.  Option -H is incompatible with options
           -a, -b, -E, -f, -H, -h, -p, -S, and -s.
## OPTIONS         top
           -a attrs
                  Set a comma-separated list of attribute selectors.
           -b searchbase
                  Set the searchbase.
           -e [!]ext[=extparam]
                  Specify general extensions with -e ´!´ indicates
                  criticality.
                  General extensions:
                    [!]assert=<filter>    (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                    !authzid=<authzid>    ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                    [!]bauthzid           (RFC 3829 authzid control)
                    [!]chaining[=<resolve>[/<cont>]]
                    [!]manageDSAit
                    [!]noop
                    ppolicy
                    [!]postread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                    [!]preread[=<attrs>]  (a comma-separated attribute list)
                    [!]relax
                    sessiontracking[=<username>]
                    abandon,cancel,ignore (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel,
                    or ignores response; if critical, doesn't wait for SIGINT.
                    not really controls)
           -E [!]ext[=extparam]
                  Set URL extensions; incompatible with -H.
           -f filter
                  Set the URL filter.  No particular check on conformity
                  with RFC 4515 LDAP filters is performed, but the value is
                  hex-escaped as required.
           -H ldapuri
                  Specify URI to be exploded.
           -h ldaphost
                  Set the host.
           -p ldapport
                  Set the TCP port.
           -S scheme
                  Set the URL scheme.  Defaults for other fields, like
                  ldapport, may depend on the value of scheme.
           -s {base|one|sub|children}
                  Specify the scope of the search to be one of base, one,
                  sub, or children to specify a base object, one-level,
                  subtree, or children search.  The default is sub.  Note:
                  children scope requires LDAPv3 subordinate feature
                  extension.
## OUTPUT FORMAT         top
           If the -H option is used, the ldapuri supplied is exploded in its
           components, which are printed to standard output in an LDIF-like
           form.
           Otherwise, the URI built using the values passed with the other
           options is printed to standard output.
## EXAMPLE         top
           The following command:
               ldapurl -h ldap.example.com -b dc=example,dc=com -s sub -f "(cn=Some One)"
           returns
               ldap://ldap.example.com:389/dc=example,dc=com??sub?(cn=Some%20One)
           The command:
               ldapurl -H ldap://ldap.example.com:389/dc=example,dc=com??sub?(cn=Some%20One)
           returns
               scheme: ldap
               host: ldap.example.com
               port: 389
               dn: dc=example,dc=com
               scope: sub
               filter: (cn=Some One)
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-
           zero exit status and a diagnostic message being written to
           standard error.
