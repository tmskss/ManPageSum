## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           qdel — delete batch jobs
## SYNOPSIS         top
           qdel job_identifier...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           A batch job is deleted by sending a request to the batch server
           that manages the batch job. A batch job that has been deleted is
           no longer subject to management by batch services.
           The qdel utility is a user-accessible client of batch services
           that requests the deletion of one or more batch jobs.
           The qdel utility shall request a batch server to delete those
           batch jobs for which a batch job_identifier is presented to the
           utility.
           The qdel utility shall delete batch jobs in the order in which
           their batch job_identifiers are presented to the utility.
           If the qdel utility fails to process any batch job_identifier
           successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
           batch job_identifiers, if any.
           The qdel utility shall delete each batch job by sending a Delete
           Job Request to the batch server that manages the batch job.
           The qdel utility shall not exit until the batch job corresponding
           to each successfully processed batch job_identifier has been
           deleted.
## OPTIONS         top
           None.
## OPERANDS         top
           The qdel utility shall accept one or more operands that conform
           to the syntax for a batch job_identifier (see Section 3.3.1,
           Batch Job Identifier).
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           qdel:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           LOGNAME   Determine the login name of the user.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           An implementation of the qdel utility may write informative
           messages to standard output.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           In addition to the default behavior, the qdel utility shall not
           be required to write a diagnostic message to standard error when
           the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the
           batch job_identifier does not exist on the server. Whether or not
           the qdel utility waits to output the diagnostic message while
           attempting to locate the job on other servers is implementation-
           defined.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           The qdel utility allows users and administrators to delete jobs.
           The qdel utility provides functionality that is not otherwise
           available. For example, the kill utility of the operating system
           does not suffice. First, to use the kill utility, the user might
           have to log in on a remote node, because the kill utility does
           not operate across the network. Second, unlike qdel, kill cannot
           remove jobs from queues. Lastly, the arguments of the qdel
           utility are job identifiers rather than process identifiers, and
           so this utility can be passed the output of the qselect utility,
           thus providing users with a means of deleting a list of jobs.
           Because a set of jobs can be selected using the qselect utility,
           the qdel utility has not been complicated with options that
           provide for selection of jobs. Instead, the batch jobs to be
           deleted are identified individually by their job identifiers.
           Historically, the qdel utility has been a component of NQS, the
           existing practice on which it is based. However, the qdel utility
           defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not provide an option
           for specifying a signal number to send to the batch job prior to
           the killing of the process; that capability has been subsumed by
           the qsig utility.
           A discussion was held about the delays of networking and the
           possibility that the batch server may never respond, due to a
           down router, down batch server, or other network mishap. The
           DESCRIPTION records this under the words ``fails to process any
           job identifier''.  In the broad sense, the network problem is
           also an error, which causes the failure to process the batch job
           identifier.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           The qdel utility may be removed in a future version.
