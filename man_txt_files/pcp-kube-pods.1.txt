## NAME         top
           pcp-kube-pods - list Kubernetes pods to scan for running PCP
           services
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/discover/pcp-kube-pods
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-kube-pods uses kubectl(1) to provide a list of IP addresses
           for PODs running in a local Kubenetes cluster, that may be
           running PCP services like pmcd(1) and pmproxy(1).
           It is used by the pmfind(1) command and the pmDiscoverServices(3)
           API as a ``shell'' command.
           The script invokes the kubectl get pod command line (see
           kubectl-get(1)) to discover IP addresses for pods.  The
           .status.podIP output field is extracted from the Kubernetes pod
           object(s).  Additional options can be specified via configuration
           file, such as -l service=database to restrict the results using
           Kubernetes pod labels.  The default configuration file is
           $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/discover/pcp-kube-pods.conf.
           If no local kubectl command is found, nothing is reported and an
           exit code indicating success is returned.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           All diagnostics produced are provided by the kubectl command.
           The kubectl exit status is propogated unchanged.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/discover
                default path to address discovery commands like pcp-kube-
                pods
           $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/discover/pcp-kube-pods.conf
                configuration file containing command line options passed to
                kubectl-get
           $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/discover/pcp-kube-pods.disabled
                existence of this file causes the script to report nothing
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
           kubectl-get(1), kubectl(1), pmcd(1), pmfind(1),
           pmDiscoverServices(3) and pcp.env(5).
