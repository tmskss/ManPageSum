## NAME         top
           df - report file system space usage
## SYNOPSIS         top
           df [OPTION]... [FILE]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This manual page documents the GNU version of df.  df displays
           the amount of space available on the file system containing each
           file name argument.  If no file name is given, the space
           available on all currently mounted file systems is shown.  Space
           is shown in 1K blocks by default, unless the environment variable
           POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.
           If an argument is the absolute file name of a device node
           containing a mounted file system, df shows the space available on
           that file system rather than on the file system containing the
           device node.  This version of df cannot show the space available
           on unmounted file systems, because on most kinds of systems doing
           so requires very nonportable intimate knowledge of file system
           structures.
## OPTIONS         top
           Show information about the file system on which each FILE
           resides, or all file systems by default.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -a, --all
                  include pseudo, duplicate, inaccessible file systems
           -B, --block-size=SIZE
                  scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g., '-BM'
                  prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format
                  below
           -h, --human-readable
                  print sizes in powers of 1024 (e.g., 1023M)
           -H, --si
                  print sizes in powers of 1000 (e.g., 1.1G)
           -i, --inodes
                  list inode information instead of block usage
           -k     like --block-size=1K
           -l, --local
                  limit listing to local file systems
           --no-sync
                  do not invoke sync before getting usage info (default)
           --output[=FIELD_LIST]
                  use the output format defined by FIELD_LIST, or print all
                  fields if FIELD_LIST is omitted.
           -P, --portability
                  use the POSIX output format
           --sync invoke sync before getting usage info
           --total
                  elide all entries insignificant to available space, and
                  produce a grand total
           -t, --type=TYPE
                  limit listing to file systems of type TYPE
           -T, --print-type
                  print file system type
           -x, --exclude-type=TYPE
                  limit listing to file systems not of type TYPE
           -v     (ignored)
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           Display values are in units of the first available SIZE from
           --block-size, and the DF_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE and BLOCKSIZE
           environment variables.  Otherwise, units default to 1024 bytes
           (or 512 if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set).
           The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K
           is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y,R,Q (powers of 1024) or
           KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).  Binary prefixes can be used, too:
           KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.
           FIELD_LIST is a comma-separated list of columns to be included.
           Valid field names are: 'source', 'fstype', 'itotal', 'iused',
           'iavail', 'ipcent', 'size', 'used', 'avail', 'pcent', 'file' and
           'target' (see info page).
