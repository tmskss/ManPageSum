## NAME         top
           lexgrog - parse header information in man pages
## SYNOPSIS         top
           lexgrog [-m|-c] [-dfw?V] [-E encoding] file ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           lexgrog is an implementation of the traditional “groff guess”
           utility in lex.  It reads the list of files on its command line
           as either man page source files or preformatted “cat” pages, and
           displays their name and description as used by apropos and
           whatis, the list of preprocessing filters required by the man
           page before it is passed to nroff or troff, or both.
           If its input is badly formatted, lexgrog will print “parse
           failed”; this may be useful for external programs that need to
           check man pages for correctness.  If one of lexgrog's input files
           is “-”, it will read from standard input; if any input file is
           compressed, a decompressed version will be read automatically.
## OPTIONS         top
           -d, --debug
                  Print debugging information.
           -m, --man
                  Parse input as man page source files.  This is the default
                  if neither --man nor --cat is given.
           -c, --cat
                  Parse input as preformatted man pages (“cat pages”).
                  --man and --cat may not be given simultaneously.
           -w, --whatis
                  Display the name and description from the man page's
                  header, as used by apropos and whatis.  This is the
                  default if neither --whatis nor --filters is given.
           -f, --filters
                  Display the list of filters needed to preprocess the man
                  page before formatting with nroff or troff.
           -E encoding, --encoding encoding
                  Override the guessed character set for the page to
                  encoding.
           -?, --help
                  Print a help message and exit.
           --usage
                  Print a short usage message and exit.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0      Successful program execution.
           1      Usage error.
           2      lexgrog failed to parse one or more of its input files.
## EXAMPLES         top
             $ lexgrog man.1
             man.1: "man - an interface to the system reference manuals"
             $ lexgrog -fw man.1
             man.1 (t): "man - an interface to the system reference manuals"
             $ lexgrog -c whatis.cat1
             whatis.cat1: "whatis - display manual page descriptions"
             $ lexgrog broken.1
             broken.1: parse failed
## WHATIS PARSING         top
           mandb (which uses the same code as lexgrog) parses the NAME
           section at the top of each manual page looking for names and
           descriptions of the features documented in each.  While the
           parser is quite tolerant, as it has to cope with a number of
           different forms that have historically been used, it may
           sometimes fail to extract the required information.
           When using the traditional man macro set, a correct NAME section
           looks something like this:
                  .SH NAME
                  foo \- program to do something
           Some manual pagers require the ‘\-’ to be exactly as shown; mandb
           is more tolerant, but for compatibility with other systems it is
           nevertheless a good idea to retain the backslash.
           On the left-hand side, there may be several names, separated by
           commas.  Names containing whitespace will be ignored to avoid
           pathological behaviour on certain ill-formed NAME sections.  The
           text on the right-hand side is free-form, and may be spread over
           multiple lines.  If several features with different descriptions
           are being documented in the same manual page, the following form
           is therefore used:
                  .SH NAME
                  foo, bar \- programs to do something
                  .br
                  baz \- program to do nothing
           (A macro which starts a new paragraph, like .PP, may be used
           instead of the break macro .br.)
           When using the BSD-derived mdoc macro set, a correct NAME section
           looks something like this:
                  .Sh NAME
                  .Nm foo
                  .Nd program to do something
           There are several common reasons why whatis parsing fails.
           Sometimes authors of manual pages replace ‘.SH NAME’ with ‘.SH
           MYPROGRAM’, and then mandb cannot find the section from which to
           extract the information it needs.  Sometimes authors include a
           NAME section, but place free-form text there rather than ‘name \-
           description’.  However, any syntax resembling the above should be
           accepted.

## NOTES         top
           lexgrog attempts to parse files containing .so requests, but will
           only be able to do so correctly if the files are properly
           installed in a manual page hierarchy.
