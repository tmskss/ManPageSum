## NAME         top
           git-fsmonitor--daemon - A Built-in Filesystem Monitor
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git fsmonitor--daemon start
           git fsmonitor--daemon run
           git fsmonitor--daemon stop
           git fsmonitor--daemon status
## DESCRIPTION         top
           A daemon to watch the working directory for file and directory
           changes using platform-specific filesystem notification
           facilities.
           This daemon communicates directly with commands like git status
           using the simple IPC[1] interface instead of the slower
           githooks(5) interface.
           This daemon is built into Git so that no third-party tools are
           required.
## OPTIONS         top
           start
               Starts a daemon in the background.
           run
               Runs a daemon in the foreground.
           stop
               Stops the daemon running in the current working directory, if
               present.
           status
               Exits with zero status if a daemon is watching the current
               working directory.
## REMARKS         top
           This daemon is a long running process used to watch a single
           working directory and maintain a list of the recently changed
           files and directories. Performance of commands such as git status
           can be increased if they just ask for a summary of changes to the
           working directory and can avoid scanning the disk.
           When core.fsmonitor is set to true (see git-config(1)) commands,
           such as git status, will ask the daemon for changes and
           automatically start it (if necessary).
           For more information see the "File System Monitor" section in
           git-update-index(1).
## CAVEATS         top
           The fsmonitor daemon does not currently know about submodules and
           does not know to filter out filesystem events that happen within
           a submodule. If fsmonitor daemon is watching a super repo and a
           file is modified within the working directory of a submodule, it
           will report the change (as happening against the super repo).
           However, the client will properly ignore these extra events, so
           performance may be affected but it will not cause an incorrect
           result.
           By default, the fsmonitor daemon refuses to work against
           network-mounted repositories; this may be overridden by setting
           fsmonitor.allowRemote to true. Note, however, that the fsmonitor
           daemon is not guaranteed to work correctly with all
           network-mounted repositories and such use is considered
           experimental.
           On Mac OS, the inter-process communication (IPC) between various
           Git commands and the fsmonitor daemon is done via a Unix domain
           socket (UDS) — a special type of file — which is supported by
           native Mac OS filesystems, but not on network-mounted
           filesystems, NTFS, or FAT32. Other filesystems may or may not
           have the needed support; the fsmonitor daemon is not guaranteed
           to work with these filesystems and such use is considered
           experimental.
           By default, the socket is created in the .git directory, however,
           if the .git directory is on a network-mounted filesystem, it will
           be instead be created at $HOME/.git-fsmonitor-* unless $HOME
           itself is on a network-mounted filesystem in which case you must
           set the configuration variable fsmonitor.socketDir to the path of
           a directory on a Mac OS native filesystem in which to create the
           socket file.
           If none of the above directories (.git, $HOME, or
           fsmonitor.socketDir) is on a native Mac OS file filesystem the
           fsmonitor daemon will report an error that will cause the daemon
           and the currently running command to exit.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           Everything below this line in this section is selectively
           included from the git-config(1) documentation. The content is the
           same as what’s found there:
           fsmonitor.allowRemote
               By default, the fsmonitor daemon refuses to work against
               network-mounted repositories. Setting fsmonitor.allowRemote
               to true overrides this behavior. Only respected when
               core.fsmonitor is set to true.
           fsmonitor.socketDir
               This Mac OS-specific option, if set, specifies the directory
               in which to create the Unix domain socket used for
               communication between the fsmonitor daemon and various Git
               commands. The directory must reside on a native Mac OS
               filesystem. Only respected when core.fsmonitor is set to
               true.
