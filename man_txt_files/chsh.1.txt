    CHSH(1)                       User Commands                      CHSH(1)
## NAME         top
           chsh - change your login shell
## SYNOPSIS         top
           chsh [-s shell] [-l] [-h] [-V] [username]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           chsh is used to change your login shell. If a shell is not given
           on the command line, chsh prompts for one.
           chsh supports non-local entries (kerberos, LDAP, etc.) if linked
           with libuser, otherwise use ypchsh(1), lchsh(1) or any other
           implementation for non-local entries.
## OPTIONS         top
           -s, --shell shell
               Specify your login shell.
           -l, --list-shells
               Print the list of shells listed in /etc/shells and exit.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit. The short options -h have been
               used since version 2.30; old versions use deprecated -u.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit. The short options -V have been used
               since version 2.39; old versions use deprecated -v.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## VALID SHELLS         top
           chsh will accept the full pathname of any executable file on the
           system.
           The default behavior for non-root users is to accept only shells
           listed in the /etc/shells file, and issue a warning for root
           user. It can also be configured at compile-time to only issue a
           warning for all users.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           Returns 0 if operation was successful, 1 if operation failed or
           command syntax was not valid.
