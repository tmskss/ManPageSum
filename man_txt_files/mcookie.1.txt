## NAME         top
           mcookie - generate magic cookies for xauth
## SYNOPSIS         top
           mcookie [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           mcookie generates a 128-bit random hexadecimal number for use
           with the X authority system. Typical usage:
              xauth add :0 . mcookie
           The "random" number generated is actually the MD5 message digest
           of random information coming from one of the sources getrandom(2)
           system call, /dev/urandom, /dev/random, or the libc pseudo-random
           functions, in this preference order. See also the option --file.
## OPTIONS         top
           -f, --file file
               Use this file as an additional source of randomness (for
               example /dev/urandom). When file is '-', characters are read
               from standard input.
           -m, --max-size number
               Read from file only this number of bytes. This option is
               meant to be used when reading additional randomness from a
               file or device.
               The number argument may be followed by the multiplicative
               suffixes KiB=1024, MiB=1024*1024, and so on for GiB, TiB,
               PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has
               the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes KB=1000,
               MB=1000*1000, and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.
           -v, --verbose
               Inform where randomness originated, with amount of entropy
               read from each source.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## FILES         top
           /dev/urandom
           /dev/random
## BUGS         top
           It is assumed that none of the randomness sources will block.
## SEE ALSO         top

## REPORTING BUGS         top

           https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues.
## AVAILABILITY         top
           The mcookie command is part of the util-linux package which can
