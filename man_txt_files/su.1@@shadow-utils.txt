    SU(1)                         User Commands                        SU(1)
## NAME         top
           su - change user ID or become superuser
## SYNOPSIS         top
           su [options] [-] [username [ args ]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The su command is used to become another user during a login
           session. Invoked without a username, su defaults to becoming the
           superuser. The - option may be used to provide an environment
           similar to what the user would expect had the user logged in
           directly. The -c option may be used to treat the next argument as
           a command by most shells.
           Options are recognized everywhere in the argument list. You can
           use the -- argument to stop option parsing. The - option is
           special: it is also recognized after --, but has to be placed
           before username.
           The user will be prompted for a password, if appropriate. Invalid
           passwords will produce an error message. All attempts, both valid
           and invalid, are logged to detect abuse of the system.
           The current environment is passed to the new shell. The value of
           $PATH is reset to /bin:/usr/bin for normal users, or
           /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin for the superuser. This may be
           changed with the ENV_PATH and ENV_SUPATH definitions in
           /etc/login.defs.
           A subsystem login is indicated by the presence of a "*" as the
           first character of the login shell. The given home directory will
           be used as the root of a new file system which the user is
           actually logged into.
## OPTIONS         top
           The options which apply to the su command are:
           -c, --command COMMAND
               Specify a command that will be invoked by the shell using its
               -c.
               The executed command will have no controlling terminal. This
               option cannot be used to execute interactive programs which
               need a controlling TTY.
           -, -l, --login
               Provide an environment similar to what the user would expect
               had the user logged in directly.
               When - is used, it must be specified before any username. For
               portability it is recommended to use it as last option,
               before any username. The other forms (-l and --login) do not
               have this restriction.
           -s, --shell SHELL
               The shell that will be invoked.
               The invoked shell is chosen from (highest priority first):
                   The shell specified with --shell.
                   If --preserve-environment is used, the shell specified by
                   the $SHELL environment variable.
                   The shell indicated in the /etc/passwd entry for the
                   target user.
                   /bin/sh if a shell could not be found by any above
                   method.
               If the target user has a restricted shell (i.e. the shell
               field of this user's entry in /etc/passwd is not listed in
               /etc/shells), then the --shell option or the $SHELL
               environment variable won't be taken into account, unless su
               is called by root.
           -m, -p, --preserve-environment
               Preserve the current environment, except for:
               $PATH
                   reset according to the /etc/login.defs options ENV_PATH
                   or ENV_SUPATH (see below);
               $IFS
                   reset to “<space><tab><newline>”, if it was set.
               If the target user has a restricted shell, this option has no
               effect (unless su is called by root).
               Note that the default behavior for the environment is the
               following:
                   The $HOME, $SHELL, $USER, $LOGNAME, $PATH, and $IFS
                   environment variables are reset.
                   If --login is not used, the environment is copied, except
                   for the variables above.
                   If --login is used, the $TERM, $COLORTERM, $DISPLAY, and
                   $XAUTHORITY environment variables are copied if they were
                   set.
                   Other environments might be set by PAM modules.
## CAVEATS         top
           This version of su has many compilation options, only some of
           which may be in use at any particular site.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
           the behavior of this tool:
           CONSOLE_GROUPS (string)
               List of groups to add to the user's supplementary groups set
               when logging in on the console (as determined by the CONSOLE
               setting). Default is none.
               Use with caution - it is possible for users to gain permanent
               access to these groups, even when not logged in on the
               console.
           DEFAULT_HOME (boolean)
               Indicate if login is allowed if we can't cd to the home
               directory. Default is no.
               If set to yes, the user will login in the root (/) directory
               if it is not possible to cd to her home directory.
           ENV_PATH (string)
               If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment
               variable when a regular user login. The value is a colon
               separated list of paths (for example /bin:/usr/bin) and can
               be preceded by PATH=. The default value is
               PATH=/bin:/usr/bin.
           ENV_SUPATH (string)
               If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment
               variable when the superuser login. The value is a colon
               separated list of paths (for example
               /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin) and can be preceded by PATH=.
               The default value is PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin.
           SULOG_FILE (string)
               If defined, all su activity is logged to this file.
           SU_NAME (string)
               If defined, the command name to display when running "su -".
               For example, if this is defined as "su" then a "ps" will
               display the command is "-su". If not defined, then "ps" would
               display the name of the shell actually being run, e.g.
               something like "-sh".
           SYSLOG_SU_ENAB (boolean)
               Enable "syslog" logging of su activity - in addition to sulog
               file logging.
## FILES         top
           /etc/passwd
               User account information.
           /etc/shadow
               Secure user account information.
           /etc/login.defs
               Shadow password suite configuration.
## EXIT VALUES         top
           On success, su returns the exit value of the command it executed.
           If this command was terminated by a signal, su returns the number
           of this signal plus 128.
           If su has to kill the command (because it was asked to terminate,
           and the command did not terminate in time), su returns 255.
           Some exit values from su are independent from the executed
           command:
           0
               success (--help only)
           1
               System or authentication failure
           126
               The requested command was not found
           127
               The requested command could not be executed
