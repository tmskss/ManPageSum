## NAME         top
           lpq - show printer queue status
## SYNOPSIS         top
           lpq [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -P
           destination[/instance] ] [ -a ] [ -l ] [ +interval ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           lpq shows the current print queue status on the named printer.
           Jobs queued on the default destination will be shown if no
           printer or class is specified on the command-line.
           The +interval option allows you to continuously report the jobs
           in the queue until the queue is empty; the list of jobs is shown
           once every interval seconds.
## OPTIONS         top
           lpq supports the following options:
           -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.
           -P destination[/instance]

           -U username
                Specifies an alternate username.
           -a   Reports jobs on all printers.
           -h server[:port]
                Specifies an alternate server.
