## NAME         top
           lpoptions - display or set printer options and defaults
## SYNOPSIS         top
           lpoptions [ -E ] [ -h server[:port] ] -d destination[/instance] [
           -l ]
           lpoptions [ -E ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -p destination[/instance]
           ] -o option[=value] ...
           lpoptions [ -E ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -p destination[/instance]
           ] -r option
           lpoptions [ -E ] [ -h server[:port] ] -x destination[/instance]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           lpoptions displays or sets printer options and defaults.  If no
           printer is specified using the -p option, the default printer is
           used as described in lp(1).
           If no -l, -o, or -r options are specified, the current options
           are reported on the standard output.
           Options set with the lpoptions command are used by the lp(1) and
           lpr(1) commands when submitting jobs.
           When run by the root user, lpoptions gets and sets default
           options and instances for all users in the /etc/cups/lpoptions
           file.  Otherwise, the per-user defaults are managed in the
           ~/.cups/lpoptions file.
## OPTIONS         top
           lpoptions supports the following options:
           -E   Enables encryption when communicating with the CUPS server.
           -d destination[/instance]
                Sets the user default printer to destination.  If instance
                is supplied then that particular instance is used.  This
                option overrides the system default printer for the current
                user.
           -h server[:port]
                Uses an alternate server.
           -l   Lists the printer specific options and their current
                settings.
           -o option[=value]
                Specifies a new option for the named destination.
           -p destination[/instance]
                Sets the destination and instance, if specified, for any
                options that follow.  If the named instance does not exist
                then it is created.  Destinations can only be created using
                the lpadmin(8) program.
           -r option
                Removes the specified option from the named destination.
           -x destination[/instance]
                Removes the options for the named destination and instance,
                if specified.  If the named instance does not exist then
                this does nothing.  Destinations can only be removed using
                the lpadmin(8) command.
## FILES         top
           ~/.cups/lpoptions - user defaults and instances created by non-
           root users.
           /etc/cups/lpoptions - system-wide defaults and instances created
           by the root user.
## CONFORMING TO         top
           The lpoptions command is unique to CUPS.
