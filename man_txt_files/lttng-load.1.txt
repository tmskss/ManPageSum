    LTTNG-LOAD(1)                 LTTng Manual                 LTTNG-LOAD(1)
## NAME         top
           lttng-load - Load LTTng tracing session configurations
## SYNOPSIS         top
           lttng [GENERAL OPTIONS] load [--force] [--input-path=PATH]
                 [--override-url=URL] [SESSION [--override-name=NAME]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The lttng load command loads the configurations of one or more
           tracing sessions from files.
           The lttng load command is used in conjunction with the
           lttng-save(1) command to save and restore the complete
           configurations of tracing sessions. This includes the enabled
           channels and event rules, the context added to channels, the
           tracing activity, and more.
           Once one or more tracing session configurations are loaded, they
           appear exactly as they were saved from the user’s point of view.
           The following directories are searched, non-recursively, in this
           order for configuration files:
            1. $LTTNG_HOME/.lttng/sessions ($LTTNG_HOME defaults to $HOME)
            2. /usr/local/etc/lttng/sessions
           The input path can be overridden with the --input-path option.
           When this option is specified, the default directories are NOT
           searched for configuration files. When it’s not specified, both
           default directories are searched for configuration files.
           If the input path is a directory, then:
           •   If SESSION is specified, the tracing session configuration
               named SESSION is searched for in all the files of this
               directory and loaded if found.
           •   If SESSION is not specified, the --all option is implicit:
               all the tracing session configurations found in all the files
               in this directory are loaded.
           If the input path is a file, then:
           •   If SESSION is specified, the tracing session configuration
               named SESSION is searched for in this file and loaded if
               found.
           •   If SESSION is not specified, the --all option is implicit:
               all the tracing session configurations found in this file are
               loaded.
           Aspects of the loaded configurations can be overridden at load
           time using the --override-url and --override-name options.
           By default, existing tracing sessions are not overwritten when
           loading: the command fails. The --force option can be used to
           allow this.
## OPTIONS         top
           General options are described in lttng(1).
           -a, --all
               Load all tracing session configurations (default).
           -f, --force
               Overwrite existing tracing sessions when loading.
           -i PATH, --input-path=PATH
               Load tracing session configurations from PATH, either a
               directory or a file, instead of loading them from the default
               search directories.
           --override-name=NAME
               Override the name of the loaded tracing session
               configuration, SESSION, with NAME.
               You must specify a tracing session name to load (SESSION) and
               NOT use the --all option when using this option.
           --override-url=URL
               Override the URL of the loaded tracing session configurations
               with URL.
               This is the equivalent of the --set-url option of
               lttng-create(1). The validity of the URL override depends on
               the type of tracing session configurations to load. This
               option applies to all the loaded tracing session
               configurations.
       Program information
           -h, --help
               Show command help.
               This option, like lttng-help(1), attempts to launch
               /usr/bin/man to view the command’s man page. The path to the
               man pager can be overridden by the LTTNG_MAN_BIN_PATH
               environment variable.
           --list-options
               List available command options.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           LTTNG_ABORT_ON_ERROR
               Set to 1 to abort the process after the first error is
               encountered.
           LTTNG_HOME
               Overrides the $HOME environment variable. Useful when the
               user running the commands has a non-writable home directory.
           LTTNG_MAN_BIN_PATH
               Absolute path to the man pager to use for viewing help
               information about LTTng commands (using lttng-help(1) or
               lttng COMMAND --help).
           LTTNG_SESSION_CONFIG_XSD_PATH
               Path in which the session.xsd session configuration XML
               schema may be found.
           LTTNG_SESSIOND_PATH
               Full session daemon binary path.
               The --sessiond-path option has precedence over this
               environment variable.
           Note that the lttng-create(1) command can spawn an LTTng session
           daemon automatically if none is running. See lttng-sessiond(8)
           for the environment variables influencing the execution of the
           session daemon.
## FILES         top
           $LTTNG_HOME/.lttngrc
               User LTTng runtime configuration.
               This is where the per-user current tracing session is stored
               between executions of lttng(1). The current tracing session
               can be set with lttng-set-session(1). See lttng-create(1) for
               more information about tracing sessions.
           $LTTNG_HOME/lttng-traces
               Default output directory of LTTng traces. This can be
               overridden with the --output option of the lttng-create(1)
               command.
           $LTTNG_HOME/.lttng
               User LTTng runtime and configuration directory.
           $LTTNG_HOME/.lttng/sessions
               Default location of saved user tracing sessions (see
               lttng-save(1) and lttng-load(1)).
           /usr/local/etc/lttng/sessions
               System-wide location of saved tracing sessions (see
               lttng-save(1) and lttng-load(1)).
               Note
               $LTTNG_HOME defaults to $HOME when not explicitly set.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0
               Success
           1
               Command error
           2
               Undefined command
           3
               Fatal error
           4
               Command warning (something went wrong during the command)
