    FLATPAK REMOTE-ADD(1)      flatpak remote-add      FLATPAK REMOTE-ADD(1)
## NAME         top
           flatpak-remote-add - Add a remote repository
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak remote-add [OPTION...] NAME LOCATION
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Adds a remote repository to the flatpak repository configuration.
           NAME is the name for the new remote, and LOCATION is a url or
           pathname. The LOCATION is either a flatpak repository, or a
           .flatpakrepo file which describes a repository. In the former
           case you may also have to specify extra options, such as the gpg
           key for the repo.
           Unless overridden with the --user or --installation options, this
           command changes the default system-wide installation.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           --from
               Assume the URI is a .flatpakrepo file rather than the
               repository itself. This is enabled by default if the
               extension is .flatpakrepo, so generally you don't need this
               option.
           -u, --user
               Modify the per-user configuration.
           --system
               Modify the default system-wide configuration.
           --installation=NAME
               Modify a system-wide installation specified by NAME among
               those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --no-gpg-verify
               Disable GPG verification for the added remote.
           --prio=PRIO
               Set the priority for the remote. Default is 1, higher is more
               prioritized. This is mainly used for graphical installation
               tools. It is also used when searching for a remote to provide
               an app's runtime. The app's origin is checked before other
               remotes with the same priority.
           --subset=SUBSET
               Limit the refs available from the remote to those that are
               part of the named subset.
           --no-enumerate
               Mark the remote as not enumerated. This means the remote will
               not be used to list applications, for instance in graphical
               installation tools.
           --no-use-for-deps
               Mark the remote as not to be used for automatic runtime
               dependency resolution.
           --if-not-exists
               Do nothing if the provided remote already exists.
           --disable
               Disable the added remote.
           --title=TITLE
               A title for the remote, e.g. for display in a UI.
           --comment=COMMENT
               A single-line comment for the remote, e.g. for display in a
               UI.
           --description=DESCRIPTION
               A full-paragraph description for the remote, e.g. for display
               in a UI.
           --homepage=URL
               URL for a website for the remote, e.g. for display in a UI.
           --icon=URL
               URL for an icon for the remote, e.g. for display in a UI.
           --default-branch=BRANCH
               A default branch for the remote, mainly for use in a UI.
           --filter=PATH
               Add a local filter to the remote. A filter file is a list of
               lines, each file starting with "allow" or "deny", and then a
               glob for the ref to allow or disallow. The globs specify a
               partial ref (i.e. you can leave out trailing parts which will
               then match everything), but otherwise only "*" is special,
               matching anything in that part of the ref.
               By default all refs are allowed, but if a ref matches a deny
               rule it is disallowed unless it specifically matches an allow
               rule. This means you can use this to implement both
               allowlisting and blocklisting.
               Here is an example filter file:
                   # This is an allowlist style filter as it denies all first
                   deny *
                   allow runtime/org.freedesktop.*
                   allow org.some.app/arm
                   allow org.signal.Signal/*/stable
                   allow org.signal.Signal.*/*/stable
           --gpg-import=FILE
               Import gpg keys from the specified keyring file as trusted
               for the new remote. If the file is - the keyring is read from
               standard input.
           --authenticator-name=NAME
               Specify the authenticator to use for the remote.
           --authenticator-option=KEY=VALUE
               Specify an authenticator option for the remote.
           --authenticator-install
               Enable auto-installation of authenticator.
           --no-authenticator-install
               Disable auto-installation of authenticator.
           --no-follow-redirect
               Do not follow xa.redirect-url defined in the summary file.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
