## NAME         top
           pcp-shping - report on shell service availability and response
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] shping [-cl?]  tag ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-shping samples and reports on the shell-ping service metrics
           exported by the pmdashping(1) agent.
           The default report from pcp-shping shows two columns for each
           service tag, the first showing service status (zero indicating
           success) and the second service response time, for the last
           pmdashping command refresh cycle.
           When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
           -O/--origin, -s/--samples, -t/--interval, -Z/--timezone and
           several other pcp options become indirectly available, see
           PCPIntro(1) for their descriptions.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -c, --status
                Display a summary of the current shell-ping collector,
                including information about service refresh interval, the
                current command timeout setting, count of refreshes, and the
                full command line associated with each tag.
           -l, --tags
                Displays the valid tags.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
