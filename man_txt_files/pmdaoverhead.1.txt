## NAME         top
           pmdaoverhead - performance metrics domain agent (PMDA) exporting
           resource consumption metrics for groups of processes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/overhead/pmdaoverhead [-C] [-c config] [-d domain]
           [-l logfile] [-R interval]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdaoverhead is a configurable Performance Metrics Domain Agent
           (PMDA) for exporting resource consumption for groups of related
           processes.
           The pmdaoverhead command line options are:
           -C  parse the configuration file(s) and exit after reporting any
               errors.
           -c  configuration file(s), config may be either a file or a
               directory; in the latter case all the files within config are
               assumed to be configuration files for pmdaoverhead and they
               will all be processed.
               Each configuration file defines one or more ``groups'' of
               processes of interest, using the syntax described in the
               ``CONFIGURATION'' section below.
               By default all configuration files below the
               $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/overhead/conf.d/ directory are used.
           -d  It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
               number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
               domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
               and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
               on all hosts.
           -l  Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
               overhead.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
               when pmdaoverhead is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If
               the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
               written to the standard error instead.
           -R  The PMDA uses a separate thread to periodically scan all
               processes to determine which processes are deemed
               ``interesting'' in each group, and extracting resource
               consumption for those processes.  The interval (in seconds)
               determines how often this scanning and resource calculation
               is done, the default is 60 (seconds).
## CONFIGURATION         top
           Each configuration file defines one or more ``groups'' of
           processes.  The file format is simple and follows the following
           rules.
           1.  Lines beginning with a hash ``#'' are treated as comments.
               More generally, except for the pattern: clause described
               below, all text between a hash and the end of line is treated
               as a comment.
           2.  White space (spaces or tabs or newlines) are required to
               separate lexical components.  Spaces and tabs are otherwise
               ignored.  Other than terminating comments and the regex in a
               pattern: clause, newlines are also ignored.
           3.  Each group is introduced by a group clause that has the form
                       group name { parameters }
               where name is a unique name for the group across all groups
               in the pmdaoverhead configuration files.  As name becomes
               embedded in the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) if must
               follow the rules for metric name components as described in
               PMNS(5), namely beginning with an alphabetic character,
               followed by zero or more characters drawn from the
               alphabetics, numerics and the underscore ``_'' character.
           4.  The parameters must include one id: clause and one pattern:
               clause.
           5.  An id: clause has the form
                       id: ident
               where ident is a unique identifier number for the group
               across all groups in the pmdaoverhead configuration files.
               Valid values for ident are in the range 0 to 4094
               (inclusive).
           6.  A pattern: clause has the form
                       pattern: regex
               where regex is an extended regular expression notation in the
               style of egrep(1).  The regex starts at the first non-
               whitespace character after pattern: and extends to the next
               newline.
               The processes that are considered to be members of the group
               are those for which the command name, as reported by
                       $ pminfo -f proc.psinfo.cmd
               is matched by regex plus all the descendents of those
               processes.  So for example the regex ^pmcd$ will match
               pmcd(1) and all the PMDA processes launched by pmcd(1) and
               any of their children, etc.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           overhead performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/overhead
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/overhead
                # ./Remove
           pmdaoverhead is launched by pmcd and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd when the
           agent is installed or removed.

                  metrics
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
