## NAME         top
           flatpak-install - Install an application or runtime
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak install [OPTION...] [REMOTE] REF...
           flatpak install [OPTION...] [--from|--bundle] LOCATION
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Installs an application or runtime. The primary way to install is
           to specify a REMOTE name as the source and one ore more REFs to
           specify the application or runtime to install. If REMOTE is
           omitted, the configured remotes are searched for the first REF
           and the user is asked to confirm the resulting choice.
           Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak
           ref format, which looks like "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All
           elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including
           the slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any
           part left out will be matched against what is in the remote, and
           if there are multiple matches you will be prompted to choose one
           of them. You will also be prompted with choices if REF doesn't
           match anything in the remote exactly but is similar to one or
           more refs in the remote (e.g. "devhelp" is similar to
           "org.gnome.Devhelp"), but this fuzzy matching behavior is
           disabled if REF contains any slashes or periods.
           By default this looks for both apps and runtimes with the given
           REF in the specified REMOTE, but you can limit this by using the
           --app or --runtime option, or by supplying the initial element in
           the REF.
           If REMOTE is a uri or a path (absolute or relative starting with
           ./) to a local repository, then that repository will be used as
           the source, and a temporary remote will be created for the
           lifetime of the REF.
           If the specified REMOTE has a collection ID configured on it,
           Flatpak will search the sideload-repos directories configured
           either with the --sideload-repo option, or on a per-installation
           or system-wide basis (see flatpak(1)).
           The alternative form of the command (with --from or --bundle)
           allows to install directly from a source such as a .flatpak
           single-file bundle or a .flatpakref application description. The
           options are optional if the first argument has the expected
           filename extension.
           Note that flatpak allows to have multiple branches of an
           application and runtimes installed and used at the same time.
           However, only one version of an application can be current,
           meaning its exported files (for instance desktop files and icons)
           are visible to the host. The last installed version is made
           current by default, but this can manually changed with flatpak
           make-current.
           Unless overridden with the --user or the --installation option,
           this command installs the application or runtime in the default
           system-wide installation.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           --bundle
               Treat LOCATION as a single-bundle file. This is assumed if
               the argument ends with .flatpak.
           --from
               Treat LOCATION as an application description file. This is
               assumed if the argument ends with .flatpakref.
           --reinstall
               Uninstall first if already installed.
           -u, --user
               Install the application or runtime in a per-user
               installation.
           --system
               Install the application or runtime in the default system-wide
               installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Install the application or runtime in a system-wide
               installation specified by NAME among those defined in
               /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using --installation=default
               is equivalent to using --system.
           --arch=ARCH
               The default architecture to install for, if not given
               explicitly in the REF. See flatpak --supported-arches for
               architectures supported by the host.
           --subpath=PATH
               Install only a subpath of REF. This is mainly used to install
               a subset of locales. This can be added multiple times to
               install multiple subpaths.
           --gpg-file=FILE
               Check bundle signatures with GPG key from FILE (- for stdin).
           --no-deploy
               Download the latest version, but don't deploy it.
           --no-pull
               Don't download the latest version, deploy whatever is locally
               available.
           --no-related
               Don't download related extensions, such as the locale data.
           --no-deps
               Don't verify runtime dependencies when installing.
           --or-update
               Normally install just ignores things that are already
               installed (printing a warning), but if --or-update is
               specified it silently turns it into an update operation
               instead.
           --app
               Assume that all REFs are apps if not explicitly specified.
           --runtime
               Assume that all REFs are runtimes if not explicitly
               specified.
           --sideload-repo=PATH
               Adds an extra local ostree repo as a source for installation.
               This is equivalent to using the sideload-repos directories
               (see flatpak(1)), but can be done on a per-command basis. Any
               path added here is used in addition to ones in those
               directories.
           --include-sdk
               For each app being installed, also installs the SDK that was
               used to build it. Implies --or-update; incompatible with
               --no-deps.
           --include-debug
               For each ref being installed, as well as all dependencies,
               also installs its debug info. Implies --or-update;
               incompatible with --no-deps.
           -y, --assumeyes
               Automatically answer yes to all questions (or pick the most
               prioritized answer). This is useful for automation.
           --noninteractive
               Produce minimal output and avoid most questions. This is
               suitable for use in non-interactive situations, e.g. in a
               build script.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
