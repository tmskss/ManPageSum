## NAME         top
           pmie_dump_stats - dump the contents of pmie stats files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmie_dump_stats file [...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Each pmie(1) process mantains a file of state and statistics in
           binary files in the $PCP_TMP_DIR/pmie directory, named with the
           process' PID.
           These files are used by the pmcd PMDA to instantiate the
           pmcd.pmie performance metrics.
           pmie_dump_stats is a stand alone utility that dumps the contents
           of these files in a terse, but script-friendly format.  It is
           designed for use in the pmiectl(1) script.
## SEE ALSO         top
           pmie(1) and pmiectl(1).
