## NAME         top
           utmpdump - dump UTMP and WTMP files in raw format
## SYNOPSIS         top
           utmpdump [options] filename
## DESCRIPTION         top
           utmpdump is a simple program to dump UTMP and WTMP files in raw
           format, so they can be examined. utmpdump reads from stdin unless
           a filename is passed.
## OPTIONS         top
           -f, --follow
               Output appended data as the file grows.
           -o, --output file
               Write command output to file instead of standard output.
           -r, --reverse
               Undump, write back edited login information into the utmp or
               wtmp files.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## NOTES         top
           utmpdump can be useful in cases of corrupted utmp or wtmp
           entries. It can dump out utmp/wtmp to an ASCII file, which can
           then be edited to remove bogus entries, and reintegrated using:
              utmpdump -r < ascii_file > wtmp
           But be warned, utmpdump was written for debugging purposes only.
       File formats
           Only the binary version of the utmp(5) is standardised. Textual
           dumps may become incompatible in future.
           The version 2.28 was the last one that printed text output using
           ctime(3) timestamp format. Newer dumps use millisecond precision
           ISO-8601 timestamp format in UTC-0 timezone. Conversion from
           former timestamp format can be made to binary, although attempt
           to do so can lead the timestamps to drift amount of timezone
           offset.
## BUGS         top
           You may not use the -r option, as the format for the utmp/wtmp
           files strongly depends on the input format. This tool was not
           written for normal use, but for debugging only.
