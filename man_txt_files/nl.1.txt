## DESCRIPTION         top
           Write each FILE to standard output, with line numbers added.
           With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -b, --body-numbering=STYLE
                  use STYLE for numbering body lines
           -d, --section-delimiter=CC
                  use CC for logical page delimiters
           -f, --footer-numbering=STYLE
                  use STYLE for numbering footer lines
           -h, --header-numbering=STYLE
                  use STYLE for numbering header lines
           -i, --line-increment=NUMBER
                  line number increment at each line
           -l, --join-blank-lines=NUMBER
                  group of NUMBER empty lines counted as one
           -n, --number-format=FORMAT
                  insert line numbers according to FORMAT
           -p, --no-renumber
                  do not reset line numbers for each section
           -s, --number-separator=STRING
                  add STRING after (possible) line number
           -v, --starting-line-number=NUMBER
                  first line number for each section
           -w, --number-width=NUMBER
                  use NUMBER columns for line numbers
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit

           -v1 -w6
           CC are two delimiter characters used to construct logical page
           delimiters; a missing second character implies ':'.  As a GNU
           extension one can specify more than two characters, and also
           specifying the empty string (-d '') disables section matching.
           STYLE is one of:
           a      number all lines
           t      number only nonempty lines
           n      number no lines
           pBRE   number only lines that contain a match for the basic
                  regular expression, BRE
           FORMAT is one of:
           ln     left justified, no leading zeros
           rn     right justified, no leading zeros
           rz     right justified, leading zeros
