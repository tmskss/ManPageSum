## NAME         top
           stg-sync - Synchronize patches with a branch or a series
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg sync <--ref-branch=BRANCH|--series=SERIES> [<patch>...|--all]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           For each of the specified patches, perform a three-way merge with
           the same patch in the specified branch or series. The command can
           be used for keeping patches on several branches in sync. Note
           that the operation may fail for some patches because of
           conflicts. The patches in the series must apply cleanly.
## OPTIONS         top
           -a, --all
               Synchronize all applied patches
           -B <branch>, --ref-branch=<branch>
               Synchronize patches with <branch>
           -S <series>, --series=<series>
               Synchronize patches with <series>
           --committer-date-is-author-date
               Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
               the author date of the commit as the committer date.
