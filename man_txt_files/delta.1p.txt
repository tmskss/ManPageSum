    DELTA(1P)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              DELTA(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           delta — make a delta (change) to an SCCS file (DEVELOPMENT)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           delta [-nps] [-g list] [-m mrlist] [-r SID] [-y[comment]] file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The delta utility shall be used to permanently introduce into the
           named SCCS files changes that were made to the files retrieved by
           get (called the g-files, or generated files).
## OPTIONS         top
           The delta utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
           that the -y option has an optional option-argument. This optional
           option-argument shall not be presented as a separate argument.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -r SID    Uniquely identify which delta is to be made to the SCCS
                     file. The use of this option shall be necessary only if
                     two or more outstanding get commands for editing (get
                     -e) on the same SCCS file were done by the same person
                     (login name). The SID value specified with the -r
                     option can be either the SID specified on the get
                     command line or the SID to be made as reported by the
                     get utility; see get(1p).
           -s        Suppress the report to standard output of the activity
                     associated with each file.  See the STDOUT section.
           -n        Specify retention of the edited g-file (normally
                     removed at completion of delta processing).
           -g list   Specify a list (see get(1p) for the definition of list)
                     of deltas that shall be ignored when the file is
                     accessed at the change level (SID) created by this
                     delta.
           -m mrlist Specify a modification request (MR) number that the
                     application shall supply as the reason for creating the
                     new delta. This shall be used if the SCCS file has the
                     v flag set; see admin(1p).
                     If -m is not used and '-' is not specified as a file
                     argument, and the standard input is a terminal, the
                     prompt described in the STDOUT section shall be written
                     to standard output before the standard input is read;
                     if the standard input is not a terminal, no prompt
                     shall be issued.
                     MRs in a list shall be separated by <blank> characters
                     or escaped <newline> characters. An unescaped <newline>
                     shall terminate the MR list. The escape character is
                     <backslash>.
                     If the v flag has a value, it shall be taken to be the
                     name of a program which validates the correctness of
                     the MR numbers. If a non-zero exit status is returned
                     from the MR number validation program, the delta
                     utility shall terminate. (It is assumed that the MR
                     numbers were not all valid.)
           -y[comment]
                     Describe the reason for making the delta. The comment
                     shall be an arbitrary group of lines that would meet
                     the definition of a text file. Implementations shall
                     support comments from zero to 512 bytes and may support
                     longer values. A null string (specified as either -y,
                     -y"", or in response to a prompt for a comment) shall
                     be considered a valid comment.
                     If -y is not specified and '-' is not specified as a
                     file argument, and the standard input is a terminal,
                     the prompt described in the STDOUT section shall be
                     written to standard output before the standard input is
                     read; if the standard input is not a terminal, no
                     prompt shall be issued. An unescaped <newline> shall
                     terminate the comment text. The escape character is
                     <backslash>.
                     The -y option shall be required if the file operand is
                     specified as '-'.
           -p        Write (to standard output) the SCCS file differences
                     before and after the delta is applied in diff format;
                     see diff(1p).
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of an existing SCCS file or a directory. If
                     file is a directory, the delta utility shall behave as
                     though each file in the directory were specified as a
                     named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component
                     of the pathname does not begin with s.)  and unreadable
                     files shall be silently ignored.
                     If exactly one file operand appears, and it is '-', the
                     standard input shall be read; each line of the standard
                     input shall be taken to be the name of an SCCS file to
                     be processed. Non-SCCS files and unreadable files shall
                     be silently ignored.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be a text file used only in the
           following cases:
            *  To read an mrlist or a comment (see the -m and -y options).
            *  A file operand shall be specified as '-'.  In this case, the
               -y option must be used to specify the comment, and if the
               SCCS file has the v flag set, the -m option must also be used
               to specify the MR list.
## INPUT FILES         top
           Input files shall be text files whose data is to be included in
           the SCCS files. If the first character of any line of an input
           file is <SOH> in the POSIX locale, the results are unspecified.
           If this file contains more than 99999 lines, the number of lines
           recorded in the header for this file shall be 99999 for this
           delta.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           delta:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error, and informative messages written to
                     standard output.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
           TZ        Determine the timezone in which the time and date are
                     written in the SCCS file. If the TZ variable is unset
                     or NULL, an unspecified system default timezone is
                     used.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           If SIGINT is caught, temporary files shall be cleaned up and
           delta shall exit with a non-zero exit code. The standard action
           shall be taken for all other signals; see Section 1.4, Utility
           Description Defaults.
## STDOUT         top
           The standard output shall be used only for the following messages
           in the POSIX locale:
            *  Prompts (see the -m and -y options) in the following formats:
                   "MRs? "
                   "comments? "
               The MR prompt, if written, shall always precede the comments
               prompt.
            *  A report of each file's activities (unless the -s option is
               specified) in the following format:
                   "%s\n%d inserted\n%d deleted\n%d unchanged\n", <New SID>,
                       <number of lines inserted>, <number of lines deleted>,
                       <number of lines unchanged>
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           Any SCCS files updated shall be files of an unspecified format.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
       System Date and Time
           When a delta is added to an SCCS file, the system date and time
           shall be recorded for the new delta. If a get is performed using
           an SCCS file with a date recorded apparently in the future, the
           behavior is unspecified.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           Problems can arise if the system date and time have been modified
           (for example, put forward and then back again, or unsynchronized
           clocks across a network) and can also arise when different values
           of the TZ environment variable are used.
           Problems of a similar nature can also arise for the operation of
           the get utility, which records the date and time in the file
           body.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
