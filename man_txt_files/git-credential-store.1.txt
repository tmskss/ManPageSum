## NAME         top
           git-credential-store - Helper to store credentials on disk
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git config credential.helper 'store [<options>]'
## DESCRIPTION         top
               Note
               Using this helper will store your passwords unencrypted on
               disk, protected only by filesystem permissions. If this is
               not an acceptable security tradeoff, try
               git-credential-cache(1), or find a helper that integrates
               with secure storage provided by your operating system.
           This command stores credentials indefinitely on disk for use by
           future Git programs.
           You probably don’t want to invoke this command directly; it is
           meant to be used as a credential helper by other parts of git.
           See gitcredentials(7) or EXAMPLES below.
## OPTIONS         top
           --file=<path>
               Use <path> to lookup and store credentials. The file will
               have its filesystem permissions set to prevent other users on
               the system from reading it, but will not be encrypted or
               otherwise protected. If not specified, credentials will be
               searched for from ~/.git-credentials and
               $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials, and credentials will be
               written to ~/.git-credentials if it exists, or
               $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials if it exists and the former
               does not. See also the section called “FILES”.
## FILES         top
           If not set explicitly with --file, there are two files where
           git-credential-store will search for credentials in order of
           precedence:
           ~/.git-credentials
               User-specific credentials file.
           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials
               Second user-specific credentials file. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is
               not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/credentials will be used.
               Any credentials stored in this file will not be used if
               ~/.git-credentials has a matching credential as well. It is a
               good idea not to create this file if you sometimes use older
               versions of Git that do not support it.
           For credential lookups, the files are read in the order given
           above, with the first matching credential found taking precedence
           over credentials found in files further down the list.
           Credential storage will by default write to the first existing
           file in the list. If none of these files exist,
           ~/.git-credentials will be created and written to.
           When erasing credentials, matching credentials will be erased
           from all files.
## EXAMPLES         top
           The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you
           must type your username or password. For example:
               $ git config credential.helper store
               $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
               Username: <type your username>
               Password: <type your password>
               [several days later]
               $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
               [your credentials are used automatically]
## STORAGE FORMAT         top
           The .git-credentials file is stored in plaintext. Each credential
           is stored on its own line as a URL like:
               https://user:pass@example.com
           No other kinds of lines (e.g. empty lines or comment lines) are
           allowed in the file, even though some may be silently ignored. Do
           not view or edit the file with editors.
           When Git needs authentication for a particular URL context,
           credential-store will consider that context a pattern to match
           against each entry in the credentials file. If the protocol,
           hostname, and username (if we already have one) match, then the
           password is returned to Git. See the discussion of configuration
           in gitcredentials(7) for more information.
