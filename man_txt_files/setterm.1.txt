    SETTERM(1)                    User Commands                   SETTERM(1)
## NAME         top
           setterm - set terminal attributes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           setterm [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           setterm writes to standard output a character string that will
           invoke the specified terminal capabilities. Where possible
           terminfo is consulted to find the string to use. Some options
           however (marked "virtual consoles only" below) do not correspond
           to a terminfo(5) capability. In this case, if the terminal type
           is "con" or "linux" the string that invokes the specified
           capabilities on the PC Minix virtual console driver is output.
           Options that are not implemented by the terminal are ignored.
## OPTIONS         top
           For boolean options (on or off), the default is on.
           Below, an 8-color can be black, red, green, yellow, blue,
           magenta, cyan, or white.
           A 16-color can be an 8-color, or grey, or bright followed by red,
           green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, or white.
           The various color options may be set independently, at least on
           virtual consoles, though the results of setting multiple modes
           (for example, --underline and --half-bright) are
           hardware-dependent.
           The optional arguments are recommended with '=' (equals sign) and
           not space between the option and the argument. For example
           --option=argument. setterm can interpret the next non-option
           argument as an optional argument too.
           --appcursorkeys on|off
               Sets Cursor Key Application Mode on or off. When on, ESC O A,
               ESC O B, etc. will be sent for the cursor keys instead of ESC
               [ A, ESC [ B, etc. See the vi and Cursor-Keys section of the
               Text-Terminal-HOWTO for how this can cause problems for vi
               users. Virtual consoles only.
           --append console_number
               Like --dump, but appends to the snapshot file instead of
               overwriting it. Only works if no --dump options are given.
           --background 8-color|default
               Sets the background text color.
           --blank[=0-60|force|poke]
               Sets the interval of inactivity, in minutes, after which the
               screen will be automatically blanked (using APM if
               available). Without an argument, it gets the blank status
               (returns which vt was blanked, or zero for an unblanked vt).
               Virtual consoles only.
               The force argument keeps the screen blank even if a key is
               pressed.
               The poke argument unblanks the screen.
           --bfreq[=number]
               Sets the bell frequency in Hertz. Without an argument, it
               defaults to 0. Virtual consoles only.
           --blength[=0-2000]
               Sets the bell duration in milliseconds. Without an argument,
               it defaults to 0. Virtual consoles only.
           --blink on|off
               Turns blink mode on or off. Except on a virtual console,
               --blink off turns off all attributes (bold, half-brightness,
               blink, reverse).
           --bold on|off
               urns bold (extra bright) mode on or off. Except on a virtual
               console, --bold off turns off all attributes (bold,
               half-brightness, blink, reverse).
           --clear[=all|rest]
               Without an argument or with the argument all, the entire
               screen is cleared and the cursor is set to the home position,
               just like clear(1) does. With the argument rest, the screen
               is cleared from the current cursor position to the end.
           --clrtabs[=tab1 tab2 tab3 ...]
               Clears tab stops from the given horizontal cursor positions,
               in the range 1-160. Without arguments, it clears all tab
               stops. Virtual consoles only.
           --cursor on|off
               Turns the terminal’s cursor on or off.
           --default
               Sets the terminal’s rendering options to the default values.
           --dump[=console_number]
               Writes a snapshot of the virtual console with the given
               number to the file specified with the --file option,
               overwriting its contents; the default is screen.dump. Without
               an argument, it dumps the current virtual console. This
               overrides --append.
           --file filename
               Sets the snapshot file name for any --dump or --append
               options on the same command line. If this option is not
               present, the default is screen.dump in the current directory.
               A path name that exceeds the system maximum will be
               truncated, see PATH_MAX from linux/limits.h for the value.
           --foreground 8-color|default
               Sets the foreground text color.
           --half-bright on|off
               Turns dim (half-brightness) mode on or off. Except on a
               virtual console, --half-bright off turns off all attributes
               (bold, half-brightness, blink, reverse).
           --hbcolor 16-color
               Sets the color for half-bright characters.
           --initialize
               Displays the terminal initialization string, which typically
               sets the terminal’s rendering options, and other attributes
               to the default values.
           --inversescreen on|off
               Swaps foreground and background colors for the whole screen.
           --linewrap on|off
               Makes the terminal continue on a new line when a line is
               full.
           --msg on|off
               Enables or disables the sending of kernel printk() messages
               to the console. Virtual consoles only.
           --msglevel 0-8
               Sets the console logging level for kernel printk() messages.
               All messages strictly more important than this will be
               printed, so a logging level of 0 has the same effect as --msg
               on and a logging level of 8 will print all kernel messages.
               klogd(8) may be a more convenient interface to the logging of
               kernel messages.
               Virtual consoles only.
           --powerdown[=0-60]
               Sets the VESA powerdown interval in minutes. Without an
               argument, it defaults to 0 (disable powerdown). If the
               console is blanked or the monitor is in suspend mode, then
               the monitor will go into vsync suspend mode or powerdown mode
               respectively after this period of time has elapsed.
           --powersave mode
               Valid values for mode are:
               vsync|on
                   Puts the monitor into VESA vsync suspend mode.
               hsync
                   Puts the monitor into VESA hsync suspend mode.
               powerdown
                   Puts the monitor into VESA powerdown mode.
               off
                   Turns monitor VESA powersaving features.
           --regtabs[=1-160]
               Clears all tab stops, then sets a regular tab stop pattern,
               with one tab every specified number of positions. Without an
               argument, it defaults to 8. Virtual consoles only.
           --repeat on|off
               Turns keyboard repeat on or off. Virtual consoles only.
           --reset
               Displays the terminal reset string, which typically resets
               the terminal to its power-on state.
           --resize
               Reset terminal size by assessing maximum row and column. This
               is useful when actual geometry and kernel terminal driver are
               not in sync. Most notable use case is with serial consoles,
               that do not use ioctl(2) but just byte streams and breaks.
           --reverse on|off
               Turns reverse video mode on or off. Except on a virtual
               console, --reverse off turns off all attributes (bold,
               half-brightness, blink, reverse).
           --store
               Stores the terminal’s current rendering options (foreground
               and background colors) as the values to be used at
               reset-to-default. Virtual consoles only.
           --tabs[=tab1 tab2 tab3 ...]
               Sets tab stops at the given horizontal cursor positions, in
               the range 1-160. Without arguments, it shows the current tab
               stop settings.
           --term terminal_name
               Overrides the TERM environment variable.
           --ulcolor 16-color
               Sets the color for underlined characters. Virtual consoles
               only.
           --underline on|off
               Turns underline mode on or off.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## COMPATIBILITY         top
           Since version 2.25 setterm has support for long options with two
           hyphens, for example --help, beside the historical long options
           with a single hyphen, for example -help. In scripts it is better
           to use the backward-compatible single hyphen rather than the
           double hyphen. Currently there are no plans nor good reasons to
           discontinue single-hyphen compatibility.
## BUGS         top
           Differences between the Minix and Linux versions are not
           documented.
