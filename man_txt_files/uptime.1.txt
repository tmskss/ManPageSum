## NAME         top
           uptime - Tell how long the system has been running.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           uptime [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           uptime gives a one line display of the following information.
           The current time, how long the system has been running, how many
           users are currently logged on, and the system load averages for
           the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
           This is the same information contained in the header line
           displayed by w(1).
           System load averages is the average number of processes that are
           either in a runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a
           runnable state is either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU.
           A process in uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O
           access, eg waiting for disk.  The averages are taken over the
           three time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized for the
           number of CPUs in a system, so a load average of 1 means a single
           CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it
           means it was idle 75% of the time.
## OPTIONS         top
           -p, --pretty
                  show uptime in pretty format
           -h, --help

           -s, --since
                  system up since, in yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS format
           -V, --version
                  display version information and exit
