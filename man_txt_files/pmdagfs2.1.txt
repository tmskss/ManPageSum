## NAME         top
           pmdagfs2 - Global Filesystem v2 (GFS2) PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdagfs2 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values about mounted GFS2 filesystems from the
           debugfs filesystem.  This PMDA requires debugfs along with at
           least one mounted GFS2 filesystem to be mounted in order to be
           able to provide metric data.
           This PMDA can be used with GFS2 filesystems which are both
           mounted as local filesystems and filesystems which are  mounted
           as shared storage within a clustered environment. However there
           are some metrics which specifically require GFS2 to be setup in a
           clustered environment to be able to provide metric data. This is
           due to them expecting locking messages to be passed via the
           distributed lock manager (DLM) between nodes of a cluster in
           order to generate their output.
           These cluster-environment-only metrics can be distinguished by
           the inclusion of their corresponding control metrics so that they
           can be optionally enabled or disabled on systems where they are
           not desired to be monitored or not supported.
           pmstore(3) can be used to assign values to these control metrics
           in order to enable (1) or disable (0) them.  This mechanism is
           also useful on distributions that do not currently have full
           support for the GFS2 trace-points or provide older versions of
           the GFS2 driver.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install the GFS2 PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2
               # ./Remove
           pmdagfs2 is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2/help
               default help text file for the GFS2 metrics
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2/Install
               installation script for the pmdagfs2 agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdagfs2 agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/gfs2.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdagfs2
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
