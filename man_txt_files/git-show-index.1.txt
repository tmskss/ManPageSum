## NAME         top
           git-show-index - Show packed archive index
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git show-index [--object-format=<hash-algorithm>]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Read the .idx file for a Git packfile (created with
           git-pack-objects(1) or git-index-pack(1)) from the standard
           input, and dump its contents. The output consists of one object
           per line, with each line containing two or three space-separated
           columns:
           •   the first column is the offset in bytes of the object within
               the corresponding packfile
           •   the second column is the object id of the object
           •   if the index version is 2 or higher, the third column
               contains the CRC32 of the object data
           The objects are output in the order in which they are found in
           the index file, which should be (in a correctly constructed file)
           sorted by object id.
           Note that you can get more information on a packfile by calling
           git-verify-pack(1). However, as this command considers only the
           index file itself, it’s both faster and more flexible.
## OPTIONS         top
           --object-format=<hash-algorithm>
               Specify the given object format (hash algorithm) for the
               index file. The valid values are sha1 and (if enabled)
               sha256. The default is the algorithm for the current
               repository (set by extensions.objectFormat), or sha1 if no
               value is set or outside a repository..
               THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL! SHA-256 support is experimental
               and still in an early stage. A SHA-256 repository will in
               general not be able to share work with "regular" SHA-1
               repositories. It should be assumed that, e.g., Git internal
               file formats in relation to SHA-256 repositories may change
               in backwards-incompatible ways. Only use
               --object-format=sha256 for testing purposes.
