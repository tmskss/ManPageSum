## NAME         top
           pmdasample - sample performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pmdasample [-d domain] [-i port] [-l logfile] [-p]
           [-u socket] [-U username]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdasample is a sample Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
           which exports a variety of synthetic performance metrics.
           This PMDA was developed as part of the quality assurance testing
           for the PCP product, but has other uses, most notably in the
           development of new PCP clients.
           The metrics exported by the sample PMDA cover the full range of
           data types, data semantics, value cardinality, instance domain
           stability and error conditions found in real PMDAs.
           A brief description of the pmdasample command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -i   Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasample on the specified TCP/IP
                port.  port may be a port number or port name.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                sample.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdasample is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
                log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -p   Expect PMCD to create a pipe and the connection to
                pmdasample is via standard input and standard output.  This
                is the default connection mode.
           -u   Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasample on the Unix domain
                socket named socket.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
           At most one of the options -i, -p and -u may be specified.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           sample performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample
                # ./Install
           Note that the installation script also installs the DSO version
           of the sample PMDA, so there are in fact two PMDAs installed, and
           two sets of performance metrics, namely sample.*  and
           sampledso.*.
           If you want to undo the installation (and remove both PMDAs), do
           the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample
                # ./Remove
           pmdasample is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
