## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-convert - convert trace files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd convert [OPTIONS] [output-file]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) convert command converts trace file. It reads
           the input file and copies the data into an output file. The
           output file may be in different format, depending on the command
           line arguments. The default output is in version 7 and compressed
           (if compiled with compression support).
## OPTIONS         top
           -i input-file
               By default, trace-cmd convert will read the file trace.dat.
               But the -i option open up the given input-file instead.
           -o out-file
               The name of the output file, this parameter is mandatory.
               Note, the output file may also be specified as the last item
               on the command line.
           --file-version
               Desired version of the output file. Supported versions are 6
               or 7.
           --compression
               Compression of the trace output file, one of these strings
               can be passed:
                   'any'  - auto select the best available compression algorithm
                   'none' - do not compress the trace file
                   'name' - the name of the desired compression algorithms. Available algorithms can be listed with
                   trace-cmd list -c
           --help
               Print usage information.
