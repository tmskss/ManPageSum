## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_listpackages [debhelper options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_listpackages is a debhelper program that outputs a list of all
           binary packages debhelper commands will act on. If you pass it
           some options, it will change the list to match the packages other
           debhelper commands would act on if passed the same options.
           Packages are listed in the order they appear in debian/control.
