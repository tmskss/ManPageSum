## NAME         top
           srptool - GnuTLS SRP tool
## SYNOPSIS         top
           srptool [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]
           All arguments must be options.
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Simple program that emulates the programs in the Stanford SRP
           (Secure Remote Password) libraries using GnuTLS.  It is intended
           for use in  places where you don't expect SRP authentication to
           be the used for system users.
           In  brief,  to use SRP you need to create two files. These are
           the password file that holds the users and the verifiers
           associated with  them  and  the configuration file to hold the
           group parameters (called tpasswd.conf).
## OPTIONS         top
           -d num, --debug=num
                  Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as
                  its argument.  The value of num is constrained to being:
                      in the range 0 through 9999
                  Specifies the debug level.
           -i num, --index=num
                  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The
                  default number for this option is:
                       3
           -u str, --username=str
           -p str, --passwd=str
           -s num, --salt=num
                  This option takes an integer number as its argument.
           --verify
                  Verifies the password provided against the password file.
           -v str, --passwd-conf=str
                  Specify a filename or a PKCS #11 URL to read the CAs from.
           --create-conf=str
                  Generate a password configuration file.
                  This generates a password configuration file
                  (tpasswd.conf) containing the required for TLS parameters.
           -v arg, --version=arg
                  Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is
                  `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright
                  information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.
           -h, --help
                  Display usage information and exit.
           -!, --more-help
                  Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
## EXAMPLES         top
           To create tpasswd.conf which holds the g and n values for SRP
           protocol (generator and a large prime), run:
               $ srptool --create-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf
           This command will create /etc/tpasswd and will add user 'test'
           (you will also be prompted for a password). Verifiers are stored
           by default in the way libsrp expects.
               $ srptool --passwd /etc/tpasswd --passwd-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf -u test
           This command will check against a password. If the password
           matches the one in /etc/tpasswd you will get an ok.
               $ srptool --passwd /etc/tpasswd --passwd\-conf /etc/tpasswd.conf --verify -u test
## EXIT STATUS         top
           One of the following exit values will be returned:
           0  (EXIT_SUCCESS)
                  Successful program execution.
           1  (EXIT_FAILURE)
                  The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
