## Description         top
           nroff formats documents written in the groff(7) language for
           typewriter-like devices such as terminal emulators.  GNU nroff
           emulates the AT&T nroff command using groff(1).  nroff generates
           output via grotty(1), groff's terminal output driver, which needs
           to know the character encoding scheme used by the device.
           Consequently, acceptable arguments to the -T option are ascii,
           latin1, utf8, and cp1047; any others are ignored.  If neither the
           GROFF_TYPESETTER environment variable nor the -T command-line
           option (which overrides the environment variable) specifies a
           (valid) device, nroff consults the locale to select an
           appropriate output device.  It first tries the locale(1) program,
           then checks several locale-related environment variables; see
           section “Environment” below.  If all of the foregoing fail,
           -Tascii is implied.
           The -b, -c, -C, -d, -E, -i, -m, -M, -n, -o, -r, -U, -w, -W, and
           -z options have the effects described in troff(1).  -c and -h
           imply “-P-c” and “-P-h”, respectively; -c is also interpreted
           directly by troff.  In addition, this implementation ignores the
           AT&T nroff options -e, -q, and -s (which are not implemented in
           groff).  The options -k, -K, -p, -P, -R, -t, and -S are
           documented in groff(1).  -V causes nroff to display the
           constructed groff command on the standard output stream, but does
           not execute it.  -v and --version show version information about
           nroff and the programs it runs, while --help displays a usage
           message; all exit afterward.
## Exit status         top
           nroff exits with error status 2 if there was a problem parsing
           its arguments, with status 0 if any of the options -V, -v,
           --version, or --help were specified, and with the status of groff
           otherwise.
## Environment         top
           Normally, the path separator in environment variables ending with
           PATH is the colon; this may vary depending on the operating
           system.  For example, Windows uses a semicolon instead.
           GROFF_BIN_PATH
                  is a colon-separated list of directories in which to
                  search for the groff executable before searching in PATH.
                  If unset, /usr/local/bin is used.
           GROFF_TYPESETTER
                  specifies the default output device for groff.
           LC_ALL
           LC_CTYPE
           LANG
           LESSCHARSET
                  are pattern-matched in this order for contents matching
                  standard character encodings supported by groff in the
                  event no -T option is given and GROFF_TYPESETTER is unset,
                  or the values specified are invalid.
## Files         top
           /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/tty-char.tmac
                  defines fallback definitions of roff special characters.
                  These definitions more poorly optically approximate
                  typeset output than those of tty.tmac in favor of
                  communicating semantic information.  nroff loads it
                  automatically.
## Notes         top
           Pager programs like more(1) and less(1) may require command-line
           options to correctly handle some output sequences; see grotty(1).
