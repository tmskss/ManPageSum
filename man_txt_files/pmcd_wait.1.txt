    PMCD_WAIT(1)             General Commands Manual            PMCD_WAIT(1)
## NAME         top
           pmcd_wait - wait for PMCD to accept client connections
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmcd_wait [-v?]  [-h host] [-t timeout]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmcd_wait waits for the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon
           (PMCD) to be running and accepting client connections.
           Unless directed to another host by the -h option, pmcd_wait will
           try to contact pmcd(1) on the local host.
           pmcd_wait will timeout and abandon the attempt to connect to pmcd
           after 60 seconds.  This default timeout interval may be changed
           using the -t option, where the interval argument follows the
           syntax described in PCPIntro(1) and in the simplest form may be
           an unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are seconds).
           On successful connection to pmcd an exit status of zero is
           returned.
           If an error or timeout occurs, then a non-zero exit status is
           returned as described below.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -h host, --host=host
                Connect pmcd(1) on host, rather than the one on the default
                localhost.
           -t timeout, --interval=timeout
                Timeout after timeout seconds if not connected.  The default
                timeout value is 60 seconds.
           -v, --verbose
                This option turns the verbose mode on.  With the verbose
                mode off (which is the default), no output will be
                generated.  With verbose mode on, error messages will be
                output on stderr.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           Error messages will be output to stderr only if the verbose mode
           is on.
           The following exit status codes are returned:
           0      pmcd_wait was able to successfully connect to pmcd within
                  the timeout period.
           1      A usage error occurred, use -v for more details.
           2      No connection was made in the timeout interval.  This will
                  happen if pmcd is running but takes too long to complete
                  the client connection, or if pmcd is not running and all
                  connection attempts in the timeout interval failed with
                  the error ECONNREFUSED.
           3      A UNIX error occurred, use -v for more details.
           4      A PCP error occurred, use -v for more details.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
