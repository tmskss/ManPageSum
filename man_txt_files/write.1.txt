    WRITE(1)                      User Commands                     WRITE(1)
## NAME         top
           write - send a message to another user
## SYNOPSIS         top
           write user [ttyname]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           write allows you to communicate with other users, by copying
           lines from your terminal to theirs.
           When you run the write command, the user you are writing to gets
           a message of the form:
                  Message from yourname@yourhost on yourtty at hh:mm ...
           Any further lines you enter will be copied to the specified
           user's terminal.  If the other user wants to reply, they must run
           write as well.
           When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt character.
           The other user will see the message EOF indicating that the
           conversation is over.
           You can prevent people (other than the superuser) from writing to
           you with the mesg(1) command.  Some commands, for example
           nroff(1) and pr(1), may automatically disallow writing, so that
           the output they produce isn't overwritten.
           If the user you want to write to is logged in on more than one
           terminal, you can specify which terminal to write to by giving
           the terminal name as the second operand to the write command.
           Alternatively, you can let write select one of the terminals - it
           will pick the one with the shortest idle time.  This is so that
           if the user is logged in at work and also dialed up from home,
           the message will go to the right place.
           The traditional protocol for writing to someone is that the
           string `-o', either at the end of a line or on a line by itself,
           means that it's the other person's turn to talk.  The string `oo'
           means that the person believes the conversation to be over.
## HISTORY         top
           A write command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
