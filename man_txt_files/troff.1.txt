## Description         top
           GNU troff transforms groff(7) language input into the device-
           independent output format described in groff_out(5); troff is
           thus the heart of the GNU roff document formatting system.  If no
           file operands are given on the command line, or if file is “-”,
           the standard input stream is read.
           GNU troff is functionally compatible with the AT&T troff
           typesetter and features numerous extensions.  Many people prefer
           to use the groff(1) command, a front end which also runs
           preprocessors and output drivers in the appropriate order and
           with appropriate options.
## Options         top
           -h and --help display a usage message, while -v and --version
           show version information; all exit afterward.
           -a     Generate a plain text approximation of the typeset output.
                  The read-only register .A is set to 1.  This option
                  produces a sort of abstract preview of the formatted
                  output.
                  • Page breaks are marked by a phrase in angle brackets;
                    for example, “<beginning of page>”.
                  • Lines are broken where they would be in the formatted
                    output.
                  • A horizontal motion of any size is represented as one
                    space.  Adjacent horizontal motions are not combined.
                    Inter-sentence space nodes (those arising from the
                    second argument to the .ss request) are not represented.
                  • Vertical motions are not represented.
                  • Special characters are rendered in angle brackets; for
                    example, the default soft hyphen character appears as
                    “<hy>”.
                  The above description should not be considered a
                  specification; the details of -a output are subject to
                  change.
           -b     Write a backtrace reporting the state of troff's input
                  parser to the standard error stream with each diagnostic
                  message.  The line numbers given in the backtrace might
                  not always be correct, because troff's idea of line
                  numbers can be confused by requests that append to macros.
           -c     Start with color output disabled.
           -C     Enable AT&T troff compatibility mode; implies -c.  See
                  groff_diff(7).
           -d ctext
           -d string=text
                  Define roff string c or string as text.  c must be one
                  character; string can be of arbitrary length.  Such string
                  assignments happen before any macro file is loaded,
                  including the startup file.  Due to getopt_long(3)
                  limitations, c cannot be, and string cannot contain, an
                  equals sign, even though that is a valid character in a
                  roff identifier.
           -E     Inhibit troff error messages; implies -Ww.  This option
                  does not suppress messages sent to the standard error
                  stream by documents or macro packages using tm or related
                  requests.
           -f fam Use fam as the default font family.
           -F dir Search in directory dir for the selected output device's
                  directory of device and font description files.  See the
                  description of GROFF_FONT_PATH in section “Environment”
                  below for the default search locations and ordering.
           -i     Read the standard input stream after all named input files
                  have been processed.
           -I dir Search the directory dir for files (those named on the
                  command line; in psbb, so, and soquiet requests; and in
                  “\X'ps: import'”, “\X'ps: file'”, and “\X'pdf: pdfpic'”
                  device control escape sequences).  -I may be specified
                  more than once; each dir is searched in the given order.
                  To search the current working directory before others, add
                  “-I .” at the desired place; it is otherwise searched
                  last.  -I works similarly to, and is named for, the
                  “include” option of Unix C compilers.
           -m name
                  Process the file name.tmac prior to any input files.  If
                  not found, tmac.name is attempted.  name (in both
                  arrangements) is presumed to be a macro file; see the
                  description of GROFF_TMAC_PATH in section “Environment”
                  below for the default search locations and ordering.
           -M dir Search directory dir for macro files.  See the description
                  of GROFF_TMAC_PATH in section “Environment” below for the
                  default search locations and ordering.
           -n num Begin numbering pages at num.  The default is 1.
           -o list
                  Output only pages in list, which is a comma-separated list
                  of inclusive page ranges; n means page n, m-n means every
                  page between m and n, -n means every page up to n, and n-
                  means every page from n on.  troff stops processing and
                  exits after formatting the last page enumerated in list.
           -r cnumeric-expression
           -r register=numeric-expression
                  Define roff register c or register as numeric-expression.
                  c must be a one-character name; register can be of
                  arbitrary length.  Such register assignments happen before
                  any macro file is loaded, including the startup file.  Due
                  to getopt_long(3) limitations, c cannot be, and register
                  cannot contain, an equals sign, even though that is a
                  valid character in a roff identifier.
           -R     Don't load troffrc and troffrc-end.
           -T dev Prepare output for device dev.  The default is ps; see
                  groff(1).
           -U     Operate in unsafe mode, enabling the open, opena, pi, pso,
                  and sy requests, which are disabled by default because
                  they allow an untrusted input document to write to
                  arbitrary file names and run arbitrary commands.  This
                  option also adds the current directory to the macro
                  package search path; see the -m and -M options above.
           -w name
           -W name
                  Enable (-w) or inhibit (-W) warnings in category name.
                  See section “Warnings” below.
           -z     Suppress formatted output.
## Warnings         top
           Warning diagnostics emitted by troff are divided into named,
           numbered categories.  The name associated with each warning
           category is used by the -w and -W options.  Each category is also
           assigned a power of two; the sum of enabled category codes is
           used by the warn request and the .warn register.  Warnings of
           each category are produced under the following circumstances.

                               category diagnoses a condition that is an
                               error when it occurs in non-ignored input.

                               used.  When such an object is dereferenced,
                               an empty one of that name is automatically
                               created.  So, unless it is later deleted, at

                               This warning is also emitted upon an attempt
                               to move an unplanted trap macro.  In such
                               cases, the unplanted macro is not
                               dereferenced, so it is not created if it does

                  shorthand is intended to produce all warnings that are
                  useful with macro packages and documents written for AT&T
                  troff and its descendants, which have less fastidious
                  diagnostics than GNU troff.
           w      All warning categories.  Authors of documents and macro
                  packages targeting groff are encouraged to use this
                  setting.
## Environment         top
           GROFF_FONT_PATH and GROFF_TMAC_PATH each accept a search path of
           directories; that is, a list of directory names separated by the
           system's path component separator character.  On Unix systems,
           this character is a colon (:); on Windows systems, it is a
           semicolon (;).
           GROFF_FONT_PATH
                  A list of directories in which to seek the selected output
                  device's directory of device and font description files.
                  troff will scan directories given as arguments to any
                  specified -F options before these, then in a site-specific
                  directory (/usr/local/share/groff/site-font), a standard
                  location (/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font), and a
                  compatibility directory (/usr/lib/font) after them.
           GROFF_TMAC_PATH
                  A list of directories in which to search for macro files.
                  troff will scan directories given as arguments to any
                  specified -M options before these, then the current
                  directory (only if in unsafe mode), the user's home
                  directory, a site-specific directory (/usr/local/share/
                  groff/site-tmac), and a standard location (/usr/local/
                  share/groff/1.23.0/tmac) after them.
           GROFF_TYPESETTER
                  Set the default output device.  If empty or not set, ps is
                  used.  The -T option overrides GROFF_TYPESETTER.
           SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
                  A timestamp (expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch) to
                  use as the output creation timestamp in place of the
                  current time.  The time is converted to human-readable
                  form using localtime(3) when the formatter starts up and
                  stored in registers usable by documents and macro
                  packages.
           TZ     The timezone to use when converting the current time (or
                  value of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH) to human-readable form; see
                  tzset(3).
## Files         top
           /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/troffrc
                  is an initialization macro file loaded before any macro
                  packages specified with -m options.
           /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/troffrc-end
                  is an initialization macro file loaded after all macro
                  packages specified with -m options.
           /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/name.tmac
                  are macro files distributed with groff.
           /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devname/DESC
                  describes the output device name.
           /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devname/F
                  describes the font F of device name.
           troffrc and troffrc-end are sought neither in the current nor the
           home directory by default for security reasons, even if the -U
           option is specified.  Use the -M command-line option or the
           GROFF_TMAC_PATH environment variable to add these directories to
           the search path if necessary.
