## NAME         top
           pmconfig - Performance Co-Pilot configuration parameters
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmconfig [-alLs?]  [name ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmconfig displays the values for some or all configuration
           parameters of the local Performance Co-Pilot toolkit
           installation.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a, --all
                Reports all configuration parameters in the default format.
           -l, --list
                Synonym for the -a option, reports the same (default)
                format.
           -L, --library
                This option changes the default reporting mode so that the
                capabilities of the PCP library are reported, rather than
                the PCP environment.
           -s, --shell
                An output format suitable for sourcing in shell scripts
                which ensures configuration information is quoted and
                preceded by an export statement.  When not reporting the
                library capabilities, this mode will produce a statement
                that does not override an existing setting in the
                environment for PCP configuration variables.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
           In the default operating mode, pmconfig is often used in
           conjunction with the $PCP_DIR environment variable to setup
           scripts running under the Windows operating system, where the
           filesystem hierarchy differs greatly to the of Linux/UNIX-based
           operating systems.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
           pmGetConfig(3), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).
