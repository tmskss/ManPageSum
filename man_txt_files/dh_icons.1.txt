## NAME         top
           dh_icons - Update caches of Freedesktop icons
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_icons [debhelper options] [-n]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_icons is a debhelper program that updates caches of
           Freedesktop icons when needed, using the update-icon-caches
           program provided by GTK+2.12.  Currently this program does not
           handle installation of the files, though it may do so at a later
           date, so should be run after icons are installed in the package
           build directories.
           It takes care of adding maintainer script fragments to call
           update-icon-caches for icon directories. (This is not done for
           gnome and hicolor icons, as those are handled by triggers.)
           These commands are inserted into the maintainer scripts by
           dh_installdeb(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --no-scripts
               Do not modify maintainer scripts.
## SEE ALSO         top
           debhelper
           This program is a part of debhelper.
