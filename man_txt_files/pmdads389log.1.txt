## NAME         top
           pmdads389log - 389 Directory Server Log PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdads389log is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts statistics from 389 Directory Server access log using
           the logconv.pl(1) utility.
## INSTALLATION         top
           pmdads389log reads configuration file
               • $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/ds389log/ds389log.conf
           This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the
           settings listed at the start of pmdads389log.pl, namely:
               • logconv.pl parameters
               • minimal query interval
               • 389 DS access log to use
               • 389 DS log directory to use (used if no file specified)
               • non-root user having read access to the access log file
           Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
           389 DS performance metrics by doing the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/ds389log
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/ds389log
               # ./Remove
           pmdads389log is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

                  389 Directory Server access log parsed by logconv.pl
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
