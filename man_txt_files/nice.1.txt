    NICE(1)                       User Commands                      NICE(1)
## NAME         top
           nice - run a program with modified scheduling priority
## SYNOPSIS         top
           nice [OPTION] [COMMAND [ARG]...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Run COMMAND with an adjusted niceness, which affects process
           scheduling.  With no COMMAND, print the current niceness.
           Niceness values range from -20 (most favorable to the process) to
           19 (least favorable to the process).
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -n, --adjustment=N
                  add integer N to the niceness (default 10)
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nice, which usually
           supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your
           shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
       Exit status:
           125    if the nice command itself fails
           126    if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked
           127    if COMMAND cannot be found
           -      the exit status of COMMAND otherwise
