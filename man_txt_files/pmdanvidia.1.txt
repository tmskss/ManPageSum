## NAME         top
           pmdanvidia - nvidia gpu metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia/pmdanvidia [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-t
           interval]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdanvidia is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts performance metrics describing the metrics available on
           NVIDIA GPU cards via the NVML library.
           The nvidia PMDA exports metrics that measure gpu activity, memory
           utilization, fan speed, etc on NVIDIA Tesla and Quadro cards.
           Metrics are unlikely to be available for consumer class cards.
           A brief description of the pmdanvidia command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                nvidia.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdanvidia is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
                log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -t   Enables and sets a sampling interval for automatic
                refreshing of metric values.  The functionality is disabled
                by default, however this option allows a time interval to be
                specified on which all values are sampled - this has the
                effect of constantly updating the accumulating metrics, with
                the goal of assisting client tools such as pcp-atop(1) and
                pmlogger(1) to observe sub-sample time changes in GPU and
                process state.  Typically these tools have longer sampling
                intervals, and can thus 'miss' activity happening during
                their sampling interval.
## INSTALLATION         top
           The nvidia PMDA is not installed and available by default.  If
           you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia
                # ./Remove
           If you want to establish access to the names, help text and
           values for the nvidia performance metrics once more, after
           removal, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia
                # ./Install
           pmdanvidia is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdanvidia
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
