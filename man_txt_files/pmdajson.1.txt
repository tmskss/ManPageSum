## NAME         top
           pmdajson - JSON PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdajson is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metrics from arbitrary sources generating JavaScript
           Object Notation (JSON) syntax.
           At least one pair of JSON inputs are required for pmdajson to
           provide metrics for PCP clients; one describing metric metadata
           and one containing metric values data.  Metadata is read once
           from a file at PMDA startup while the data is read every time a
           request for metric values is made by a PCP client.  The data is
           read either from a JSON file or an external command generating
           JSON output.  More than one pair of JSON inputs can be used to
           support arbitrary number of metric sources in different
           configured directories.
           The overall JSON format description is at http://www.json.org/ .
## JSON DATA SOURCES         top
           pmdajson reads a mandatory JSON configuration file
               • $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/json/config.json
           This file can contain the following PMDA options using the JSON
           syntax:
               • directory_list
               • trusted_directory_list
           pmdajson searches the directories listed for these options
           looking for files named metadata.json and (by default) data.json.
           The JSON metadata files describe the metric names, types, and
           other details of the associated JSON metric data.  The JSON data
           file name is configurable, and can also be an external command
           instead of a periodically updated (by external tools) data file.
           Each of these found JSON file/command pairs form a JSON data
           source.
           For example, let us assume the following simple JSON data file
           that contains values for two metrics, one of type string and one
           numeric:
             {
               "string_value": "testing, 1, 2, 3",
               "read_count": 0
             }
           For these metrics the metadata file needed by pmdajson would be:
             {
               "metrics": [
                 {
                   "name": "string_value",
                   "pointer": "/string_value",
                   "type": "string"
                 },
                 {
                   "name": "read_count",
                   "pointer": "/read_count",
                   "type": "integer",
                   "description": "Times values read"
                 }
               ]
             }
           For further details on the JSON metadata format and options, see
           the README file included as part of pmdajson installation.
## SECURITY MODEL         top
           JSON data sources listed for the directory_list option are not
           trusted, meaning that if external commands to generate the needed
           JSON data are used, these commands are run as user nobody.
           JSON data sources listed for the trusted_directory_list option
           are trusted, meaning that if external commands to generate the
           needed JSON data are used, these commands are run as user root.
           For further details on security and description on running
           external commands, see the README file included as part of
           pmdajson installation.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install the JSON PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/json
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/json
               # ./Remove
           pmdajson is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top

                  additional documentation for pmdajson used JSON files

           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/json.log
                  default log file for messages from the pmdajson agent
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
