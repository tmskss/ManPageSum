## NAME         top
           pmsignal - send a signal to one or more processes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsignal [-alnp] [-s signal] [PID ...|name ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmsignal provides a cross-platform event signalling mechanism for
           use with tools from the Performance Co-Pilot toolkit.  It can be
           used to send a named signal (only HUP, USR1, TERM, and KILL are
           accepted) to one or more processes.
           The processes are specified directly using PIDs or as program
           names (with either the -a or -p options).  In the all case, the
           set of all running processes is searched for a basename(1) match
           on name.  In the program case, process identifiers are extracted
           from files in the $PCP_RUN_DIR directrory where file names are
           matched on name.pid.
           The -n option reports the list of process identifiers that would
           have been signalled, but no signals are actually sent.
           If a signal is not specified, then the TERM signal will be sent.
           The list of supported signals is reported when using the -l
           option.
           On Linux and UNIX platforms, pmsignal is a simple wrapper around
           the kill(1) command.  On Windows, the is no direct equivalent to
           this mechanism, and so an alternate mechanism has been
           implemented - this is only honoured by PCP tools, however, not
           all Windows utilities.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a, --all
                Send signal to all named processes.
           -l, --list
                List supported signals.
           -n, --dry-run
                List processes that would be affected.
           -p, --program
                Extract programs from PCP runtime PID files.
           -s signal, --signal=signal
                Specify the signal to send, one of: HUP, USR1, TERM, KILL.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
           basename(1), kill(1), killall(1), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).
