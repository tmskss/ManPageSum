## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg fold [OPTIONS] [file]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Fold diff file into the current patch. The given GNU diff file
           (or standard input) is applied onto the current patch.
           With the --threeway option, the diff is applied onto the bottom
           of the current patch and a three-way merge is performed with the
           current top. With the --base option, the diff is applied onto the
           specified base and a three-way merge is performed with the
           current top.

           -t, --threeway
               Perform a three-way merge with the current patch

               Use <committish> instead of HEAD when applying the patch
           -p <n>, --strip=<n>
               Remove <n> leading components from diff paths (default 1)
           -C <n>
