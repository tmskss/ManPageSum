## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installmenu is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           installing files used by the Debian menu package into package
           build directories.
           It also automatically generates the postinst and postrm commands

           are inserted into the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb(1).

               Debian menu files, installed into usr/share/menu/package in
               the package build directory. See menufile(5) for its format.
           debian/package.menu-method
               Debian menu method files, installed into
               etc/menu-methods/package in the package build directory.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --no-scripts
