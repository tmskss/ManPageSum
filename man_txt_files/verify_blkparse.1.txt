## NAME         top
           verify_blkparse - verifies an output file produced by blkparse
## SYNOPSIS         top
           verify_blkparse <filename>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Verifies an output file from blkparse. All it does is check if
           the events in the file are correctly time ordered. If an entry is
           found that isn't ordered, it's dumped to stdout.
## AUTHORS         top
           blkparse was written by Jens Axboe, Alan D. Brunelle and Nathan
           Scott.  This man page was created from the blktrace documentation
           by Bas Zoetekouw.
