    RUNCON(1)                     User Commands                    RUNCON(1)
## NAME         top
           runcon - run command with specified security context
## SYNOPSIS         top
           runcon CONTEXT COMMAND [args]
           runcon [ -c ] [-u USER] [-r ROLE] [-t TYPE] [-l RANGE] COMMAND
           [args]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Run COMMAND with completely-specified CONTEXT, or with current or
           transitioned security context modified by one or more of LEVEL,
           ROLE, TYPE, and USER.
           If none of -c, -t, -u, -r, or -l, is specified, the first
           argument is used as the complete context.  Any additional
           arguments after COMMAND are interpreted as arguments to the
           command.
           Note that only carefully-chosen contexts are likely to
           successfully run.
           Run a program in a different SELinux security context.  With
           neither CONTEXT nor COMMAND, print the current security context.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           CONTEXT
                  Complete security context
           -c, --compute
                  compute process transition context before modifying
           -t, --type=TYPE
                  type (for same role as parent)
           -u, --user=USER
                  user identity
           -r, --role=ROLE
                  role
           -l, --range=RANGE
                  levelrange
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
       Exit status:
           125    if the runcon command itself fails
           126    if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked
           127    if COMMAND cannot be found
           -      the exit status of COMMAND otherwise
