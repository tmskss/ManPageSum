## NAME         top
           systemd-cgls - Recursively show control group contents
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-cgls [OPTIONS...] [CGROUP...]
           systemd-cgls [OPTIONS...] --unit|--user-unit [UNIT...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           systemd-cgls recursively shows the contents of the selected Linux
           control group hierarchy in a tree. If arguments are specified,
           shows all member processes of the specified control groups plus
           all their subgroups and their members. The control groups may
           either be specified by their full file paths or are assumed in
           the systemd control group hierarchy. If no argument is specified
           and the current working directory is beneath the control group
           mount point /sys/fs/cgroup/, shows the contents of the control
           group the working directory refers to. Otherwise, the full
           systemd control group hierarchy is shown.
           By default, empty control groups are not shown.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           --all
               Do not hide empty control groups in the output.
           -l, --full
               Do not ellipsize process tree members.
           -u, --unit
               Show cgroup subtrees for the specified units.
           --user-unit
               Show cgroup subtrees for the specified user units.
           -k
               Include kernel threads in output.
           -M MACHINE, --machine=MACHINE
               Limit control groups shown to the part corresponding to the
               container MACHINE.
           -x, --xattr=
               Controls whether to include information about extended
               attributes of the listed control groups in the output. With
               the long option, expects a boolean value. Defaults to no.
           -c, --cgroup-id=
               Controls whether to include the numeric ID of the listed
               control groups in the output. With the long option, expects a
               boolean value. Defaults to no.
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
           --no-pager
               Do not pipe output into a pager.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
