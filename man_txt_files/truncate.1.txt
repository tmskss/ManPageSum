## NAME         top
           truncate - shrink or extend the size of a file to the specified
           size
## SYNOPSIS         top
           truncate OPTION... FILE...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified size
           A FILE argument that does not exist is created.
           If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is
           lost.  If a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the sparse
           extended part (hole) reads as zero bytes.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -c, --no-create
                  do not create any files
           -o, --io-blocks
                  treat SIZE as number of IO blocks instead of bytes
           -r, --reference=RFILE
                  base size on RFILE
           -s, --size=SIZE
                  set or adjust the file size by SIZE bytes
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K
           is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y,R,Q (powers of 1024) or
           KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).  Binary prefixes can be used, too:
           KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.
           SIZE may also be prefixed by one of the following modifying
           characters: '+' extend by, '-' reduce by, '<' at most, '>' at
           least, '/' round down to multiple of, '%' round up to multiple
           of.
