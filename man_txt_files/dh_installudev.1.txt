## NAME         top
           dh_installudev - install udev rules files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installudev [debhelper options] [-n] [--name=name]
           [--priority=priority]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installudev is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           installing udev rules files.
## FILES         top
           debian/package.udev
               Installed into lib/udev/rules.d/ in the package build
               directory.
## OPTIONS         top
           --name=name
               When this parameter is used, dh_installudev looks for and
               installs files named debian/package.name.udev instead of the
               usual debian/package.udev.
           --priority=priority
               Sets the priority the file. Default is 60.
## NOTES         top
           Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
           called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may
           cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
           maintainer scripts.
## SEE ALSO         top
           debhelper(7)
           This program is a part of debhelper.
