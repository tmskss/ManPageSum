## NAME         top
           dh_installalternatives - install declarative alternative rules
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installalternatives [debhelper options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installalternatives is a debhelper program that is responsible
           for parsing the declarative alternatives format and insert the
           relevant maintscripts snippets to interface with
           update-alternatives(1)
## FILES         top
           debian/package.alternatives
               An example of the format:
                   Name: editor
                   Link: /usr/bin/editor
                   Alternative: /usr/bin/vim.basic
                   Dependents:
                     /usr/share/man/man1/editor.1.gz editor.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/vim.1.gz
                     /usr/share/man/fr/man1/editor.1.gz editor.fr.1.gz /usr/share/man/fr/man1/vim.1.gz
                     /usr/share/man/it/man1/editor.1.gz editor.it.1.gz /usr/share/man/it/man1/vim.1.gz
                     /usr/share/man/pl/man1/editor.1.gz editor.pl.1.gz /usr/share/man/pl/man1/vim.1.gz
                     /usr/share/man/ru/man1/editor.1.gz editor.ru.1.gz /usr/share/man/ru/man1/vim.1.gz
                   Priority: 50
               The fields Link, Name, Alternative, and Priority are
               mandatory and correspond to the update-alternatives(1)
               --install parameters link, name, path, and priority
               respectively.
               The Dependents field is optional and consists of one or more
               lines. Each non-empty line must contain exactly 3 space
               separated values that match (in order) the values passed to
               the --slave parameter for update-alternatives(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --no-scripts
               Do not modify postinst/postrm/prerm scripts.
