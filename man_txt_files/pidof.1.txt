    PIDOF(1)                      User Commands                     PIDOF(1)
## NAME         top
           pidof - find the process ID of a running program
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pidof [-s] [-c] [-q] [-w] [-x] [-o omitpid[,omitpid...]...]  [-S
           separator] program [program...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Pidof finds the process id's (pids) of the named programs. It
           prints those id's on the standard output.
## OPTIONS         top
           -s     Single shot - this instructs the program to only return
                  one pid.
           -c     Only return process ids that are running with the same
                  root directory.  This option is ignored for non-root
                  users, as they will be unable to check the current root
                  directory of processes they do not own.
           -q     Quiet mode, suppress any output and only sets the exit
                  status accordingly.
           -w     Show also processes that do not have visible command line
                  (e.g. kernel worker threads).
           -x     Scripts too - this causes the program to also return
                  process id's of shells running the named scripts.
           -o omitpid
                  Tells pidof to omit processes with that process id. The
                  special pid %PPID can be used to name the parent process
                  of the pidof program, in other words the calling shell or
                  shell script.
           -S separator
                  Use separator as a separator put between pids. Used only
                  when more than one pids are printed for the program.  The
                  -d option is an alias for this option for sysvinit pidof
                  compatibility.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0      At least one program was found with the requested name.
           1      No program was found with the requested name.
## BUGS         top
           When using the -x option, pidof only has a simple method for
           detecting scripts and will miss scripts that, for example, use
           env. This limitation is due to how the scripts look in the proc
           filesystem.
