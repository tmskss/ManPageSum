## NAME         top
           stap-prep - prepare system for systemtap use
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stap-prep [ KERNEL_VERSION ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The stap-prep executable prepares the system for systemtap use by
           installing kernel headers, debug symbols and build tools that
           match the currently running kernel or optionally the kernel
           version given by the user.
           If the debuginfod-find tool is installed and is able to fetch
           debuginfo for a kernel component, it is assumed to remain
           available later.  In this case, no debug symbols will be
           downloaded during stap-prep.
           The exact behavior of stap-prep may be customized by the
           distribution maintainers. It might for example only give
           suggestions and not actually install the required packages if
           that is difficult to automate.
## EXAMPLES         top
                  $ stap-prep
                  Please install linux-image-3.2.0-2-amd64-dbg
