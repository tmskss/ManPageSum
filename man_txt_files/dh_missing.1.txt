    DH_MISSING(1)                   Debhelper                  DH_MISSING(1)
## NAME         top
           dh_missing - check for missing files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_missing [-Xitem] [--sourcedir=dir] [debhelper options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_missing compares the list of installed files with the files in
           the source directory. If any of the files (and symlinks) in the
           source directory were not installed to somewhere, it will warn on
           stderr about that (--list-missing) or fail (--fail-missing).
           Please note that in compat 11 and earlier without either of these
           options, dh_missing will silently do nothing.  In compat 12,
           --list-missing is the default  In compat 13 and later,
           --fail-missing is the default.
           This may be useful if you have a large package and want to make
           sure that you don't miss installing newly added files in new
           upstream releases.
           Remember to test different kinds of builds (dpkg-buildpackage
           -A/-B/...) as you may experience varying results when only a
           subset of the packages are built.
## FILES         top
           debian/not-installed
               List the files that are deliberately not installed in any
               binary package.  Paths listed in this file are ignored by
               dh_missing.  However, it is not a method to exclude files
               from being installed by any of the debhelper tool.  If you
               want a tool to not install a given file, please use its
               --exclude option (where available).
               dh_missing will expand wildcards in this file (since
               debhelper 11.1).  Wildcards without matches will be ignored.
               Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
               documented in debhelper(7).
## OPTIONS         top
           --list-missing
               Warn on stderr about source files not installed to somewhere.
               Note that many dh-tools acting on a path will mark the path
               as installed even if it has been excluded via -X or
               --exclude.  This is also seen when a dh-tool is acting on a
               directory and exclusion is used to ignore some files in the
               directory.  In either case, this will make dh_missing
               silently assume the excluded files have been handled.
               This is the default in compat 12.
           --fail-missing
               This option is like --list-missing, except if a file was
               missed, it will not only list the missing files, but also
               fail with a nonzero exit code.
               This is the default in compat 13 and later.
