## NAME         top
           pmdadenki - metrics related to the systems electrical consumption
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/denki/pmdadenki [-d domain] [-l logfile]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdadenki is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts electricity related performance metrics.
           Currently, metrics from RAPL (on Intel cpus) and battery charge
           values are available, if supported by the hardware.
           -l Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
           denki.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
           pmdadenki is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file
           cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to the
           standard error instead.
## INSTALLATION         top
           The denki PMDA is installed and available by default on Linux.
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/denki
                # ./Remove
           If you want to establish access to the names, help text and
           values for the denki metrics once more, after removal, do the
           following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/denki
                # ./Install
           pmdadenki is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH
                  command line options used to launch pmdadenki
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/denki/help
                  default help text file for the denki metrics
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/denki/Install
                  installation script for the pmdadenki agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/denki/Remove
                  undo installation script for the pmdadenki agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/denki.log
                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdadenki
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top

           pcp.env(5).
