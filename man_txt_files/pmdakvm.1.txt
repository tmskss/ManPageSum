## NAME         top
           pmdakvm - Linux virtualization performance metrics domain agent
           (PMDA)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdakvm is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values from the Linux KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine)
           virtualization subsystem.
           Per-processor KVM trace metrics from the kernel events enumerated
           below /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kvm can be configured
           statically using the pmdakvm configuration file,
           /etc/pcp/kvm/kvm.conf.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Optionally configure trace points in the configuration file, then
           install the KVM PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/kvm
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/kvm
               # ./Remove
           pmdakvm is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## CAVEATS         top
           When pmdakvm is running, it holds references to kernel resources
           within the KVM device driver.  It is thus not possible to unload
           or reload the device driver module while the PMDA is running.
           The ideal procedure to follow in order to reload the kernel
           module is the reverse of that described in the ``INSTALLATION''
           section above - i.e. first run ./Remove, then reload the kernel
           module, then run ./Install.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/kvm/kvm.conf
               configuration file for the pmdakvm agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/kvm/Install
               installation script for the pmdakvm agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/kvm/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdakvm agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/kvm.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdakvm
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
