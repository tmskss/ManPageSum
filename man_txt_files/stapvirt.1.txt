## NAME         top
           stapvirt - prepare libvirt domains for systemtap probing
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stapvirt [-c URI] [-d PATH] [-v] COMMAND ARGUMENTS
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The stapvirt program can be used to add ports to domains managed
           by libvirt (see <http://libvirt.org/>).  These ports can then be
           used by stap to run scripts inside the domains (see the
           '--remote' option in stap(1) for more information).
           Ports are added to the definition of the domain using the port-
           add command.  These ports can later be removed using the port-
           remove command.  Note that there can only be as many simultaneous
           stap sessions as there are ports.
           Starting from libvirt v1.1.1 and QEMU v0.10.0, SystemTap ports
           can be hotplugged and thus do not need to be added first using
           the port-add command.  However, you need to ensure that there is
           a virtio-serial controller in place so that hotplugged ports can
           be connected. If creating a domain using virt-install, you can do
           this by adding this option:
                  $ virt-install [...] --controller=virtio-serial
           If the domain has already been created, you can simply do port-
           add followed immediately by port-remove, and then power off and
           restart the domain. The port will be removed, but the controller
           will remain.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are supported. Any other option prints a
           short help message.
           -c URI Specify the libvirt driver URI to which to connect (e.g.
                  'qemu:///system'). The default value is NULL, which
                  indicates to libvirt to connect to the default driver. See
                  the page at <http://libvirt.org/uri.html> for supported
                  values.
           -d PATH
                  Specify the directory in which UNIX sockets should be
                  created when SystemTap ports are added. The default
                  directory is '/var/lib/libvirt/qemu'.
           -v     Increase verbosity. This option may be repeated for more
                  verbosity.
## COMMANDS         top
           The following commands are recognized by stapvirt. Any other
           command prints a short help message.
           help   Display the help message.
           list   List available domains.
           port-add DOMAIN
                  Add a permanent SystemTap port to the domain's definition.
                  If the domain is currently running, it must be powered off
                  before changes take effect.
           port-list DOMAIN
                  List the UNIX socket paths of the permanent SystemTap
                  ports in the domain's definition.
           port-remove DOMAIN
                  Remove a permanent SystemTap port from the domain's
                  definition. If the domain is currently running, it must be
                  powered off before changes take effect.
           query DOMAIN
                  Display the following information about the domain: its
                  name, its UUID, its state, the number of permanent
                  SystemTap ports installed, and whether hotplugging is
                  supported.
## TUTORIAL         top
           This tutorial will help you get started with stapvirt. Let's
           start by listing all the privileged domains on the machine with
           the list command:
                  $ stapvirt -c 'qemu:///system' list
                  Available domains on URI 'qemu:///system':
                  ID      State     Type        Name
                  2       running   persistent  TestVM
           Note that we specified the libvirt URI using the -c switch.
           Otherwise libvirt might have defaulted to e.g. 'qemu:///session'.
           Rather than typing the URI everytime, it might be easier to
           instead set the LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI environment variable and omit
           the -c switch. Note that this is a libvirt functionality (see
           <libvirt.org/uri.html> for more details).
           The list command indicates that we have a running domain named
           'TestVM' with ID 2. Let's use the query command to retrieve more
           information:
                  $ stapvirt query TestVM # by name
                  $ stapvirt query 2      # by ID
                                Name:  TestVM
                                UUID:  905951c0-fa4f-409b-079c-c91ddda27028
                               State:  running
                                  ID:  2
                                Type:  persistent
                     Permanent Ports:  0
                         Hotplugging:  not supported
           The query command gives us some basic information about the
           domain, such as its name, UUID, and state. More importantly, it
           gives us two pieces of information: the number of permanent ports
           installed, and whether hotplugging is supported.  Technically,
           hotplugging support depends on libvirt and qemu, and is not
           related to the domain in itself.
           If hotplugging were supported, we could stop here and run stap
           directly (assuming we have a virtio-serial controller already in
           place, see DESCRIPTION). Since in our case hotplugging is not
           supported, we need to add SystemTap ports. To do this, we use the
           port-add command:
                  $ stapvirt port-add TestVM
                  Added new port org.systemtap.stapsh.0
                  The domain must be powered off before changes take effect.
           We can confirm that a port was added by running the query command
           again:
                  $ stapvirt query TestVM
                  ...
                     Permanent Ports:  1
                         Hotplugging:  not supported
           It now indicates that there is 1 permanent port. We can also use
           the port-list command to know exactly where the port will be
           created:
                  $ stapvirt port-list TestVM
                  /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/TestVM.org.systemtap.stapsh.0.sock
           After powering off and restarting the domain, we are now ready to
           use the port with stap:
                  $ stap -e 'probe begin { printf("Hello from TestVM!\n"); exit() }' \
                         --remote=libvirt://TestVM
                  Hello from TestVM!
           Finally, if we'd like to remove the port, we can use the port-
           remove command:
                  $ stapvirt port-remove TestVM
                  Removed port org.systemtap.stapsh.0
                  The domain must be powered off before changes take effect.
           And that's all there is to it!
