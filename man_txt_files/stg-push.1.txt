## NAME         top
           stg-push - Push (apply) one or more unapplied patches
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg push [OPTIONS] [patch]...
           stg push [OPTIONS] -n <number>
           stg push [OPTIONS] --all
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Push one or more unapplied patches from the series onto the
           stack.
           By default, the first unapplied patch is pushed.
           Unapplied patches may be pushed in arbitrary order, but out of
           order pushes may result in merge conflicts. If there are
           conflicts while pushing a patch, the conflicts are written to the
           work tree and the push command halts. Conflicts may then be
           resolved using the normal Git methods, or alternatively the push
           may be undone using stg-undo(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           -a, --all
               Push all unapplied patches
           -n <n>, --number=<n>
               Push the specified number of patches.
               A negative number indicates to push all but that number of
               patches
           --reverse
               Push the patches in reverse order
           --noapply
               Reorder patches by pushing without applying
           --set-tree
               Push patches keeping their original trees.
               For each patch pushed, instead of performing a merge, the
               patch is pushed such the resulting tree will be identical to
               the tree associated with the patch.
               This can be useful when splitting a patch by first popping
               the patch and creating a new patch with some of the changes.
               Pushing the original patch with --set-tree will avoid
               conflicts and only the remaining changes will be in the
               patch.
           -k, --keep
               Keep the local changes
           -m, --merged
               Check for patches merged upstream
           --committer-date-is-author-date
               Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
               the author date of the commit as the committer date.
           --conflicts[=<policy>]
               Either "allow" or "disallow" pushing a patch with conflicts.
               Using --conflicts=allow (or just --conflicts) allows pushing
               a patch that may result in unresolved merge conflicts. The
               patch will be pushed and files with conflicts will be left
               with conflict markers to be resolved manually; or the
               operation undone with stg undo --hard. This is the default
               behavior and also corresponds to the
               "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" variable being set to "true".
               Using --conflicts=disallow disallows pushing any patch that
               would result in merge conflicts. The operation will stop on
               the last patch that can be pushed without conflicts. This
               behavior can be configured by setting
               "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" to "false".
