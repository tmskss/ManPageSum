## NAME         top
           pmdatrivial - trivial performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/pmdatrivial [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-U
           username]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdatrivial is the simplest possible Performance Metrics Domain
           Agent (PMDA) which exports a single performance metric, the time
           in seconds since the 1st of January, 1970.
           The trivial PMDA is shipped as source code and is designed to be
           an aid for PMDA developers.
           A brief description of the pmdatrivial command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                trivial.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdatrivial is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If
                the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           trivial performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial
                # ./Remove
           pmdatrivial is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top

           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/Install
                  installation script for the pmdatrivial agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trivial/Remove
                  undo installation script for the pmdatrivial agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/trivial.log
                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdatrivial
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
