## NAME         top
           pmdanginx - nginx performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdanginx is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports performance metrics from nginx(8) - an HTTP and reverse
           proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP proxy
           server.
## INSTALLATION         top
           This PMDA requires that the nginx stub_status module is active
           and available at http://localhost/nginx_status .
           In order to enable this module, the "server" section of the
           nginx.conf configuration file should contain the following.
                location /nginx_status {
                    stub_status on;
                    access_log off;
                    allow 127.0.0.1;
                    allow ::1;
                    deny all;
                }
           Instrumentation availability can be verified using these commands
           (compile-time then run-time checks):
               # nginx -V 2>&1 | grep -o with-http_stub_status_module
               # curl http://localhost/nginx_status
           Install the nginx PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nginx
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nginx
               # ./Remove
           pmdanginx is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nginx/nginx.conf
               optional configuration file for pmdanginx
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nginx/Install
               installation script for the pmdanginx agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nginx/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdanginx agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/nginx.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdanginx
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
