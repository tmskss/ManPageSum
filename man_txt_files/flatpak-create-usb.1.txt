## NAME         top
           flatpak-create-usb - Copy apps and/or runtimes onto removable
           media.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak create-usb [OPTION...] MOUNT-PATH REF...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Copies the specified apps and/or runtimes REFs onto the removable
           media mounted at MOUNT-PATH, along with all the dependencies and
           metadata needed for installing them. This is one way of
           transferring flatpaks between computers that doesn't require an
           Internet connection. After using this command, the USB drive can
           be connected to another computer which already has the relevant
           remote(s) configured, and Flatpak will install or update from the
           drive offline (see below). If online, the drive will be used as a
           cache, meaning some objects will be pulled from it and others
           from the Internet. For this process to work a collection ID must
           be configured on the relevant remotes on both the source and
           destination computers, and on the remote server.
           On the destination computer one can install from the USB (or any
           mounted filesystem) using the --sideload-repo option with flatpak
           install. It's also possible to configure sideload paths using
           symlinks; see flatpak(1). Flatpak also includes systemd units to
           automatically sideload from hot-plugged USB drives, but these may
           or may not be enabled depending on your Linux distribution.
           Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak
           ref format, which looks like "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All
           elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including
           the slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any
           part left out will be matched against what is installed, and if
           there are multiple matches an error message will list the
           alternatives.
           By default this looks for both installed apps and runtimes with
           the given REF, but you can limit this by using the --app or
           --runtime option.
           All REFs must be in the same installation (user, system, or
           other). Otherwise it's ambiguous which repository metadata refs
           to put on the USB drive.
           By default flatpak create-usb uses .ostree/repo as the
           destination directory under MOUNT-PATH but if you specify another
           location using --destination-repo a symbolic link will be created
           for you in .ostree/repos.d. This ensures that either way the
           repository will be found by flatpak (and other consumers of
           libostree) for install/update operations.
           Unless overridden with the --system, --user, or --installation
           options, this command searches both the system-wide installation
           and the per-user one for REF and errors out if it exists in more
           than one.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -u, --user
               Copy refs from the per-user installation.
           --system
               Copy refs from the default system-wide installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Copy refs from a system-wide installation specified by NAME
               among those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --app
               Assume that all REFs are apps if not explicitly specified.
           --runtime
               Assume that all REFs are runtimes if not explicitly
               specified.
           --destination-repo=DEST
               Create the repository in DEST under MOUNT-PATH, rather than
               the default location.
           --allow-partial
               Don't print a warning when exporting partially installed
               commits, for example locale extensions without all languages.
               These can cause problems when installing them, for example if
               the language config is different on the installing side.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
