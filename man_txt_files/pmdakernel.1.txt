## DESCRIPTION         top
           Each supported platform has a kernel Performance Metrics Domain
           Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics from the kernel
           of that platfrom.  A variety of platform-specific metrics are
           available, with an equally varied set of access mechanisms -
           typically this involves special system calls, or reading from
           files in kernel virtual filesystems such as the Linux sysfs and
           procfs filesystems.
           The platform kernel PMDA is one of the most critical components
           of the PCP installation, and must be as efficient and reliable as
           possible.  In all installations the default kernel PMDA will be
           installed as a shared library and thus executes directly within
           the pmcd(1) process.  This slightly reduces overheads associated
           with querying the metadata and values associated with these
           metrics (no message passing is required).
           Unlike many other PMDAs, the kernel PMDA exports a number of
           metric namespace subtrees, such as kernel, network, swap, mem,
           ipc, filesys, nfs, disk and hinv (hardware inventory).
           Despite usually running as shared libraries, most installations
           also include a stand-alone executable for the kernel PMDA.  This
           is to aid profiling and debugging activities, with dbpmda(1) for
           example.  In this case (but not for shared libraries), the
           following command line options are available:
           -A   Disables use of the credentials provided by PMAPI client
                tools, and simply runs everything under the "root" account.
                Only enable this option if you understand the risks
                involved, and are sure that all remote accesses will be from
                benevolent users.  If enabled, unauthenticated remote PMAPI
                clients will be able to access potentially sensitive
                performance metric values which an unauthenticated PMAPI
                client usually would not be able to.  Refer to CVE-2012-3419
                for additional details.
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                [platform].log is written in the current directory of
                pmcd(1) when pmda[platform] is started, i.e.
                $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file cannot be created or is
                not writable, output is written to the standard error
                instead.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                either the privileged "root" account on some platforms
                (Linux, for example) or the unprivileged "pcp" account
                (wherever possible).
## INSTALLATION         top
           Access to the names, help text and values for the kernel
           performance metrics is available by default - unlike most other
           agents, no action is required to enable them and they should not
           be removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/[platform]/help
                  default help text file for the the kernel metrics
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/[platform].log
                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from the kernel PMDA.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
