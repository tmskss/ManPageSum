    NEWROLE(1)                         NSA                        NEWROLE(1)
## NAME         top
           newrole - run a shell with a new SELinux role
## SYNOPSIS         top
           newrole [-r|--role] ROLE [-t|--type] TYPE [-l|--level]
           [-p|--preserve-environment] LEVEL [-- [ARGS]...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Run a new shell in a new context.  The new context is derived
           from the old context in which newrole is originally executed.  If
           the -r or --role option is specified, then the new context will
           have the role specified by ROLE.  If the -t or --type option is
           specified, then the new context will have the type (domain)
           specified by TYPE.  If a role is specified, but no type is
           specified, the default type is derived from the specified role.
           If the -l or --level option is specified, then the new context
           will have the sensitivity level specified by LEVEL.  If LEVEL is
           a range, the new context will have the sensitivity level and
           clearance specified by that range.  If the -p or --preserve-
           environment option is specified, the shell with the new SELinux
           context will preserve environment variables, otherwise a new
           minimal environment is created.
           Additional arguments ARGS may be provided after a -- option, in
           which case they are supplied to the new shell.  In particular, an
           argument of -- -c will cause the next argument to be treated as a
           command by most command interpreters.
           If a command argument is specified to newrole and the command
           name is found in /etc/selinux/newrole_pam.conf, then the pam
           service name listed in that file for the command will be used
           rather than the normal newrole pam configuration.  This allows
           for per-command pam configuration when invoked via newrole, e.g.
           to skip the interactive re-authentication phase.
           The new shell will be the shell specified in the user's entry in
           the /etc/passwd file.
           The -V or --version shows the current version of newrole
## EXAMPLE         top
           Changing role:
              # id -Z
              staff_u:staff_r:staff_t:SystemLow-SystemHigh
              # newrole -r sysadm_r
              # id -Z
              staff_u:sysadm_r:sysadm_t:SystemLow-SystemHigh
           Changing sensitivity only:
              # id -Z
              staff_u:sysadm_r:sysadm_t:Unclassified-SystemHigh
              # newrole -l Secret
              # id -Z
              staff_u:sysadm_r:sysadm_t:Secret-SystemHigh
           Changing sensitivity and clearance:
              # id -Z
              staff_u:sysadm_r:sysadm_t:Unclassified-SystemHigh
              # newrole -l Secret-Secret
              # id -Z
              staff_u:sysadm_r:sysadm_t:Secret
           Running a program in a given role or level:
              # newrole -r sysadm_r -- -c "/path/to/app arg1 arg2..."
              # newrole -l Secret -- -c "/path/to/app arg1 arg2..."
## FILES         top
           /etc/passwd - user account information
           /etc/shadow - encrypted passwords and age information
           /etc/selinux/<policy>/contexts/default_type - default types for
           roles
           /etc/selinux/<policy>/contexts/securetty_types - securetty types
           for level changes
           /etc/selinux/newrole_pam.conf - optional mapping of commands to
           separate pam service names
