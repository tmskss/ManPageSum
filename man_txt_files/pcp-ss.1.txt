## NAME         top
           pcp-ss - report socket statistics
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] ss [ss options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-ss reports socket statistics collected by the pmdasockets(1)
           PMDA agent.  The command is intended to be reasonably compatible
           with many of the ss(8) command line options and reporting
           formats, but also offer the advantages of local or remote
           monitoring (in live mode) and also historical replay from a
           previously recorded PCP archive.  Note that since ss(1) has many
           command line options, many of which are the same as standard PCP
           command line options as described in PCPIntro(1), the pcp-ss tool
           should always be invoked by users using the pcp front-end.  This
           allows standard PCP commandline options such as -h, -a, -S, -T,
           -O, -z, etc to be passed without conflict with ss(1) options.
           See the EXAMPLES sections below for typical usage and command
           lines.
           Live mode uses the pcp -h host option and requires the
           pmdasockets(1) PMDA to be installed and enabled on the target
           host (local or remote), see pmdasockets(1) for details on how to
           enable the sockets PMDA on a particular host.  The default source
           is live metrics collected on localhost, if neither of the -h or
           -a options are given.
           Historical/archive replay uses the pcp -a archive option, where
           archive is the basename of a previously recorded PCP archive.
           The archive replay feature is particularly useful because socket
           statistics can be reported for a designated time using the pcp
           --origin option (which defaults to the start time of the
           archive).
## EXAMPLES         top
           pcp ss
                Display default basic socket information for the local host.
                This includes Netid (tcp, udp, etc), State (ESTAB,
                TIME_WAIT, etc), Recv-Q and Send-Q queue lengths and the
                local and peer address and port for each socket.
           pcp -h somehost ss -noemitauO
                Display the same basic socket information as above for the
                host somehost, which may be the default localhost.  The
                additional command line arguments (-noemitauO) display one
                line per socket (-O), numeric (-n) service names (default),
                timer information (-o), extended socket details (-e), socket
                memory usage (-m), internal TCP information (-i), both udp
                (-u) and tcp sockets (-t) and both listening and non-
                listening sockets (-a).
           pcp -a somearchive -S'@Wed 16 Jun 2021 12:57:21' ss -noemitauO
                Display the same information as the above example, but for
                the archive somearchive starting at the given time Wed 16
                Jun 2021 12:57:21.  Note the literal @ prefix is required
                for an absolute time, see PCPIntro(1) for details.  The
                archive must of course contain data for the requested time.
                You can use pmdumplog -l somearchive to examine the time
                bounds of somearchive.
           pcp -a somearchive -O-0 ss -noemitauO
                As above, but with an offset of zero seconds (-O-0) before
                the current end of somearchive, i.e. the most recently
                logged data. Note that somearchive may be curently growing
                (i.e. being logged with pmlogger(1)).
## OPTIONS         top
           Due to the large number of options supported by pcp-ss, the
           pcp(1) command should always be used to invoke pcp-ss in order to
           specify options such as the metrics source (host or archive) and
           also (in archive mode), the requested start time or offset, and
           timezone using the following options:
           -h, --host
                The remote hostname to connect to in live mode.
           -a, --archive
                The archive file to use for historical sampling
           -O, --origin
                The time offset to use within an archive (implies -a)
           -S, --start
                The start time (e.g. in ctime(3) format) to use when
                replaying an archive.
           -Z, --timezone
                Use a specific timezone.  Since pcp-ss doesn't report
                timestamps, this only affects the interpretation of an
                absolute starting time (-S) or offset (-O).
           -z, --hostzone
                In archive mode, use the timezone of the archive rather than
                the timezone on the local machine running pcp-ss.  The
                timezone, start and finish times of the archive may be
                examined using pmdumplog(1) with the -L option.
           The above pcp options become indirectly available to the pcp-ss
           command via environment variables - refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
           complete description of these options.
           The additional command line options available for pcp-ss itself
           are:
           -h, --help
                show help message and exit
           -V, --version
                output version information
           -n, --numeric
                don't resolve service names
           -r, --resolve
                resolve host names
           -a, --all
                display all sockets
           -l, --listening
                display listening sockets
           -o, --options

                show bpf filter socket information

           -Z, --context

           -z, --contexts
                display process and socket SELinux security contexts
           -N, --net

           -4, --ipv4
                display only IP version 4 sockets
           -6, --ipv6
                display only IP version 6 sockets
           -0, --packet
                display PACKET sockets

           -O, --oneline
                socket's data printed on a single line
## REPORT         top
           The columns in the pcp-ss report vary according to the command
           line options and have the same interpretation as described in
           ss(8).
           One difference with pcp-ss is that the first line in the report
           begins with '# Timestamp' followed by the timestamp (in the
           requested timezone, see -z and -Z above) of the sample data from
           the host or archive source.  Following the timestamp is the
           currently active filter string for the metrics source.  In
           archive mode, the active filter can be changed dynamically, even
           whilst the archive is being recorded.  This is different to ss(8)
           where the filter is optionally specified on the command line of
           the tool and is always 'live', i.e.  ss(8) does not support
           retrospective replay.  With pcp-ss, the filter is stored in the
           back-end PMDA, see pmdasockets(1), in the metric
           network.persocket.filter.  The default filter is state connected,
           which can be changed by storing a new string value in the
           network.persocket.filter metric using pmstore(1), e.g.  pmstore
           network.persocket.filter "state established".  This will override
           the persistent default filter, which is stored in a PMDA
           configuration file and loaded each time the sockets PMDA is
           started.  See pmdasockets(1) for further details and see ss(8)
           for details of the filter syntax and examples.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
