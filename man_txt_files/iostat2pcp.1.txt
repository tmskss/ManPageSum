## NAME         top
           iostat2pcp - import iostat data and create a PCP archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           iostat2pcp [-v] [-S start] [-t interval] [-V version] [-Z
           timezone] infile outfile
## DESCRIPTION         top
           iostat2pcp reads a text file created with iostat(1) (infile) and
           translates this into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with
           the basename outfile.  If infile is ``-'' then iostat2pcp reads
           from standard input, allowing easy preprocessing of the iostat(1)
           output with sed(1) or similar.
           The resultant PCP archive may be used with all the PCP client
           tools to graph subsets of the data using pmchart(1), perform data
           reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
           pmie(1), etc.
           A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
           outfile.  These are outfile.0 (the performance data),
           outfile.meta (the metadata that describes the performance data)
           and outfile.index (a temporal index to improve efficiency of
           replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
           already, then iostat2pcp will not overwrite them and will exit
           with an error message.
           The first output sample from iostat(1) contains a statistical
           summary since boot time and is ignored by iostat2pcp, so the
           first real data set is the second one in the iostat(1) output.
           The best results are obtained when iostat(1) was run with its own
           -t flag, so each output sample is prefixed with a timestamp.
           Even better is -t with $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO set in environment when
           iostat(1) is run, in which case the timestamp includes the
           timezone.
           Note that if $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO is not used with the -t option
           then iostat(1) may produce a timestamp controlled by LC_TIME from
           the locale that is in a format iostat2pcp cannot parse.  The
           formats for the timestamp that iostat2pcp accepts are illustrated
           by these examples:
           2013-07-06T21:34:39+1000
               (for the $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO).
           2013-07-06 21:34:39
               (for some of the European formats, e.g. de_AT, de_BE, de_LU
               and en_DK.utf8).
           06/07/13 21:34:39
               (for all of the $LC_TIME settings for English locales outside
               North America, e.g. en_AU, en_GB, en_IE, en_NZ, en_SG and
               en_ZA, and all the Spanish locales, e.g. es_ES, es_MX and
               es_AR).
           In particular, note that some common North American $LC_TIME
           settings will not work with iostat2pcp (namely, en_US, POSIX and
           C) because they use the MM/DD format which may be incorrectly
           converted with the assumed DD/MM format.  This is another reason
           to recommend setting $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO.
           If there are no timestamps in the input stream, iostat2pcp will
           try and deduce the sample interval if basic Disk data (-d option
           for iostat(1)) is found.  If this fails, then the -t option may
           be used to specify the sample interval in seconds.  This option
           is ignored if timestamps are found in the input stream.
           The -S option may be used to specify as start time for the first
           real sample in infile, where start must have the format HH:MM:SS.
           This option is ignored if timestamps are found in the input
           stream.
           The -V option specifies the version for the output PCP archive.
           By default the archive version $PCP_ARCHIVE_VERSION (set to 2 in
           current PCP releases) is used, and the only values currently
           supported for version are 2 or 3.
           The -Z option may be used to specify a timezone.  It must have
           the format +HHMM (for hours and minutes East of UTC) or -HHMM
           (for hours and minutes West of UTC).  Note in particular that
           neither the zoneinfo (aka Olson) format, e.g. Europe/Paris, nor
           the Posix TZ format, e.g.  EST+5 is allowed for the -Z option.
           This option is ignored if ISO timestamps are found in the input
           stream.  If the timezone is not specified and cannot be deduced,
           it defaults to ``UTC''.
           Some additional diagnostic output is generated with the -v
           option.
           iostat2pcp is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
           wrapper around the PCP libpcp_import library, and as such could
           be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
           of performance data and create PCP archives.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -S start
                Specify the start time for the first sample.
           -t interval
                Specify the sample interval in seconds.
           -v   Print verbose output.
           -Z timezone
                Specify the timezone to use, see above.
## CAVEATS         top
           iostat2pcp requires infile to have been created by the version of
           iostat(1) from http://freshmeat.net/projects/sysstat .
           iostat2pcp handles the -c (CPU), -d (Disk), -x (eXtended Disk)
           and -p (Partition) report formats (including their -k, -m, -z and
           ALL variants), but does not accommodate the -n (Network
           Filesystem) report format from iostat(1); this is a demand-driven
           limitation rather than a technical limitation.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
           iostat(1), pmchart(1), pmie(1), pmlogger(1), sed(1),
           Date::Format(3pm), Date::Parse(3pm), PCP::LogImport(3pm) and
           LOGIMPORT(3).
