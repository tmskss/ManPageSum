## NAME         top
           flatpak-uninstall - Uninstall an application or runtime
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak uninstall [OPTION...] [REF...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Uninstalls an application or runtime.  REF is a reference to the
           application or runtime to uninstall.
           Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak
           ref format, which looks like "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All
           elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including
           the slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any
           part left out will be matched against what is installed, and if
           there are multiple matches you will be prompted to choose between
           them. You will also be prompted if REF doesn't match any
           installed ref exactly but is similar (e.g. "gedit" is similar to
           "org.gnome.gedit"), but this fuzzy matching behavior is disabled
           if REF contains any slashes or periods.
           By default this looks for both installed apps and runtimes with
           the given REF, but you can limit this by using the --app or
           --runtime option, or by supplying the initial element in the REF.
           Normally, this command removes the ref for this
           application/runtime from the local OSTree repository and purges
           any objects that are no longer needed to free up disk space. If
           the same application is later reinstalled, the objects will be
           pulled from the remote repository again. The --keep-ref option
           can be used to prevent this.
           When --delete-data is specified while removing an app, its data
           directory in ~/.var/app and any permissions it might have are
           removed. When --delete-data is used without a REF, all 'unowned'
           app data is removed.
           Unless overridden with the --system, --user, or --installation
           options, this command searches both the system-wide installation
           and the per-user one for REF and errors out if it exists in more
           than one.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           --keep-ref
               Keep the ref for the application and the objects belonging to
               it in the local repository.
           -u, --user
               Uninstalls from a per-user installation.
           --system
               Uninstalls from the default system-wide installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Uninstalls from a system-wide installation specified by NAME
               among those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --arch=ARCH
               The architecture to uninstall, instead of the architecture of
               the host system. See flatpak --supported-arches for
               architectures supported by the host.
           --all
               Remove all refs on the system.
           --unused
               Remove unused refs on the system.
           -y, --assumeyes
               Automatically answer yes to all questions. This is useful for
               automation.
           --noninteractive
               Produce minimal output and avoid most questions. This is
               suitable for use in non-interactive situations, e.g. in a
               build script.
           --app
               Only look for an app with the given name.
           --runtime
               Only look for a runtime with the given name.
           --no-related
               Don't uninstall related extensions, such as the locale data.
           --force-remove
               Remove files even if they're in use by a running application.
           --delete-data
               Remove app data in ~/.var/app and in the permission store.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
