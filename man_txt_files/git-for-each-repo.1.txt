## NAME         top
           git-for-each-repo - Run a Git command on a list of repositories
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git for-each-repo --config=<config> [--] <arguments>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Run a Git command on a list of repositories. The arguments after
           the known options or -- indicator are used as the arguments for
           the Git subprocess.
           THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.
           For example, we could run maintenance on each of a list of
           repositories stored in a maintenance.repo config variable using
               git for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run
           This will run git -C <repo> maintenance run for each value <repo>
           in the multi-valued config variable maintenance.repo.
## OPTIONS         top
           --config=<config>
               Use the given config variable as a multi-valued list storing
               absolute path names. Iterate on that list of paths to run the
               given arguments.
               These config values are loaded from system, global, and local
               Git config, as available. If git for-each-repo is run in a
               directory that is not a Git repository, then only the system
               and global config is used.
## SUBPROCESS BEHAVIOR         top
           If any git -C <repo> <arguments> subprocess returns a non-zero
           exit code, then the git for-each-repo process returns that exit
           code without running more subprocesses.
           Each git -C <repo> <arguments> subprocess inherits the standard
           file descriptors stdin, stdout, and stderr.

           system) project.  Information about the project can be found at
           ⟨http://git-scm.com/⟩.  If you have a bug report for this manual
           page, see ⟨http://git-scm.com/community⟩.  This page was obtained
           from the project's upstream Git repository
