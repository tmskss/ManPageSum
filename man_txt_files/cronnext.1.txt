    CRONNEXT(1)                   User Commands                  CRONNEXT(1)
## NAME         top
           cronnext - time of next job cron will execute
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cronnext [-i users] [-e users] [-s] [-a] [-t time] [-q time] [-j
                    command] [-l] [-c] [-f] [-h] [-V] [file]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Determine the time cron will execute the next job.  Without
           arguments, it prints that time considering all crontabs, in
           number of seconds since the Epoch, rounded to the minute. This
           number can be converted into other formats using date(1), like
           date --date @43243254
           The file arguments are optional. If provided, cronnext uses them
           as crontabs instead of the ones installed in the system.
## OPTIONS         top
           -i user,user,user,...
                  Consider only the crontabs of the specified users.  Use
                  *system* for the system crontab.
           -e user,user,user,...
                  Do not consider the crontabs of the specified users.
           -s     Do not consider the system crontab, usually the
                  /etc/crontab file.  The system crontab usually contains
                  the hourly, daily, weekly and monthly crontabs, which
                  might be better dealt with anacron(8).
           -a     Use the crontabs installed in the system in addition to
                  the ones passed as file arguments. This is implicit if no
                  file is passed.
           -t time
                  Determine the next job from this time, instead of now.
                  The time is expressed in number of seconds since the
                  Epoch, as obtained for example by date +%s --date "now + 2
                  hours", and is internally rounded to the minute.
           -q time
                  Do not check jobs over this time, expressed in the same
                  way as in option -t.
           -j command
                  Only look for jobs that contain command as a substring.
           -l     Print the whole entries of the jobs that are the next to
                  be executed by cron.  The default is to only print their
                  next time of execution.
           -c     Print every entry in every crontab with the next time it
                  is executed.
           -f     Print all jobs that are executed in the given interval.
                  Requires option -q.
           -h     Print usage output and exit.
           -V     Print version and exit.
