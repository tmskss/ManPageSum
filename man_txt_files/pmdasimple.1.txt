## NAME         top
           pmdasimple - simple performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/pmdasimple [-d domain] [-i port] [-l
           logfile] [-p] [-u socket] [-U username]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdasimple is a simple Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
           which exports a small number of synthetic performance metrics.
           The simple PMDA is shipped as source code and is designed to be
           an aid for PMDA developers.  In terms of code size and features,
           it is more complex than the trivial PMDA, about the same as the
           txmon PMDA and less complex than the sample PMDA.  The source for
           the simple PMDA is a good template from which production,
           customized PMDAs can be developed.
           A brief description of the pmdasimple command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -i   Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasimple on the specified TCP/IP
                port.  port may be a port number or port name.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                simple.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdasimple is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
                log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -p   Expect PMCD to create a pipe and the connection to
                pmdasimple is via standard input and standard output.  This
                is the default connection mode.
           -u   Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasimple on the Unix domain
                socket named socket.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
           At most one of the options -i, -p and -u may be specified.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access the names, help text and values for the simple
           performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple
                # ./Remove
           pmdasimple is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH
                  command line options used to launch pmdasimple
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/help
                  default help text file for the simple metrics
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/Install
                  installation script for the pmdasimple agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/Remove
                  undo installation script for the pmdasimple agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/simple.conf
                  configuration file for the dynamic instance domain that
                  underlies the simple.now performance metric.  For a
                  description, refer to the help text file, or run the
                  command
                  $ pminfo -T simple.now
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple/*.pmda_simple.so
                  The DSO version of the PMDA.  The same source is used to
                  create both the DSO and the daemon versions of the simple
                  PMDA, and one or the other may be installed as part of the
                  dialog in the Install script.
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/simple.log
                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdasimple
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
