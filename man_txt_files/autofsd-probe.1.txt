    AUTOFSD-PROBE(1)         General Commands Manual        AUTOFSD-PROBE(1)
## NAME         top
           autofsd-probe - probe AutoFS mount/unmount daemon
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/autofsd-probe [-h host] [-t timeout]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           autofsd-probe will check the status of the autofsd(1) daemon on
           the specified host.
           Unless directed to another host by the -h option, autofsd-probe
           will contact the AutoFS daemon on the local host.
           The AutoFS file system is built on the Remote Procedure Call
           (RPC(3)) library routines.  The -t option allows the total
           timeout and retry timeout intervals to be set for all remote
           procedure call operations used with autofsd-probe.  This option
           accepts an interval argument in the form described in the
           PCPIntro(1) manual page.
           autofsd-probe is typically used in an automated fashion from
           within pmdashping(1) and in conjunction with pmie(1), for
           monitoring response time and service failure.
           By default autofsd-probe will not produce any output, unless
           there is an error in which case a diagnostic message will be
           displayed and the exit status will indicate the reason for
           failure.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           If autofsd-probe succeeds, then 0 will be returned.  If the
           attempt to establish a connection with autofsd fails, then 2 is
           returned.  If the subsequent attempt to invoke an autofsd
           response fails, then 1 will be returned.
           In the case of a syntactical command line error, 4 is returned
           and the usage message is displayed.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
