    GIT-MAILSPLIT(1)               Git Manual               GIT-MAILSPLIT(1)
## NAME         top
           git-mailsplit - Simple UNIX mbox splitter program
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git mailsplit [-b] [-f<nn>] [-d<prec>] [--keep-cr] [--mboxrd]
                           -o<directory> [--] [(<mbox>|<Maildir>)...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Splits a mbox file or a Maildir into a list of files: "0001"
           "0002" .. in the specified directory so you can process them
           further from there.
               Important
               Maildir splitting relies upon filenames being sorted to
               output patches in the correct order.
## OPTIONS         top
           <mbox>
               Mbox file to split. If not given, the mbox is read from the
               standard input.
           <Maildir>
               Root of the Maildir to split. This directory should contain
               the cur, tmp and new subdirectories.
           -o<directory>
               Directory in which to place the individual messages.
           -b
               If any file doesn’t begin with a From line, assume it is a
               single mail message instead of signaling error.
           -d<prec>
               Instead of the default 4 digits with leading zeros, different
               precision can be specified for the generated filenames.
           -f<nn>
               Skip the first <nn> numbers, for example if -f3 is specified,
               start the numbering with 0004.
           --keep-cr
               Do not remove \r from lines ending with \r\n.
           --mboxrd
               Input is of the "mboxrd" format and "^>+From " line escaping
               is reversed.
