## NAME         top
           pmdapostgresql - PostgreSQL database PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdapostgresql is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance
           Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts live performance data
           from a running PostgreSQL database server.
           Many of the statistics available from a PostgreSQL server may not
           be enabled by default.  Refer to the online documentation
           https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/monitoring-stats.html 
           which describes each of the available parameters related to
           statistics collection and how to enable them.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           pmdapostgresql reads a mandatory ini-style configuration file:
                  $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/postgresql/postgresql.conf
           This file currently contains only one section [authentication]
           which specifies values for the following settings (their default
           values are shown in parenthesis):
           host (local)
                  Hostname to connect to.
           port (5432)
                  Port number to use.
           dbname (postgres)
                  Database name.
           username (postgres)
                  Username to run as and to connect to the database.
           password (password)
                  Password to connect to the database.
           osuser (unset)
                  Operating system user the PMDA runs as.
           The defaults (as above) will result in the PMDA running as the
           current user, using a UNIX domain socket connection to the
           PostgreSQL server on the localhost.
           If osuser is not specified in the configuration file, the PMDA
           will run as the current user.  A host specification of local will
           use a UNIX domain socket, which uses peer authentication, see
           comments in the pg_hba.conf file.  In this case, the osuser
           setting should probably be set to postgres.
           It is generally not necessary to alter the default configuration
           file for monitoring the local PostgreSQL server instance with a
           default server configuration.  Note that the port number is
           required even for a UNIX domain connection because it's used as
           the socket filename by the server.
## INSTALLATION         top
           To install, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/postgresql
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/postgresql
               # ./Remove
           pmdapostgresql is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
           executed directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1)
           when the agent is installed or removed.
           pmdapostgresql will automatically attempt to reconnect to the
           PostgreSQL server if its connection is lost - e.g. if the
           PostgreSQL service is restarted.
## SUPPORTED VERSIONS         top
           This version of pmdapostgresql has been tested and verified with
           PostgreSQL server version 10.2 and earlier.  Later versions will
           probably also work correctly because the PMDA probes the various
           performance tables on start-up to determine the column ordering.
           It also tolerates missing or renamed tables and/or columns.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/postgresql/pmdapostgresql.conf
                configuration file for the pmdapostgresql agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/postgresql/Install
                installation script for the pmdapostgresql agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/postgresql/Remove
                undo installation script for the pmdapostgresql agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/postgresql.log
                default log file for messages from the pmdapostgresql agent
           Note that the usual/default value for $PCP_PMDAS_DIR is
           /var/lib/pcp/pmdas and the default for $PCP_LOG_DIR is
           /var/log/pcp but these settings are platform dependent.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
