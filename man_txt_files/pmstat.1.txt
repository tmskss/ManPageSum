## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmstat provides a one line summary of system performance every
           interval unit of time (the default is 5 seconds).  pmstat is
           intended to monitor system performance at the highest level,
           after which other tools may be used to examine subsystems in
           which potential performance problems may be observed in greater
           detail.
           pcp-vmstat is a simple wrapper for use with the pcp(1) command,
           providing a more familiar command line format for some users.  It
           also enables the extended reporting option by default, see the -x
           option below.
           Multiple hosts may be monitored by supplying more than one host
           with multiple -h flags (for live monitoring) or by providing a
           name of the hostlist file, where each line contain one host name,
           with -H, or multiple -a flags (for retrospective monitoring from
           sets of archives).
           By default, pmstat fetches metrics by connecting to the
           Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host.
           If the -L option is specified, then pmcd(1) is bypassed, and
           metrics are fetched from PMDAs on the local host using the
           standalone PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL variant of pmNewContext(3).  When the
           -h option is specified, pmstat connects to the pmcd(1) on host
           and fetches metrics from there.  As mentioned above, multiple
           hosts may be monitored by supplying multiple -h flags.
           Alternatively, if the -a option is used, the metrics are
           retrieved from the Performance Co-Pilot archive log files
           identified by archive, which is a comma-separated list of names,
           each of which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a
           directory containing one or more archives.  Multiple sets of
           archives may be replayed by supplying multiple -a flags.  When
           the -a flag is used, the -P flag may also be used to pause the
           output after each interval.
           Standalone mode can only connect to the local host, using a set
           of archives implies a host name, and nominating a host precludes
           using an archive, so the options -L, -a and -h are mutually
           exclusive.
           pmstat may relinquish its own timing control, and operate under
           the control of a pmtime(1) process that uses a GUI dialog to
           provide timing control.  In this case, either the -g option
           should be used to start pmstat as the sole client of a new
           pmtime(1) instance, or -p should be used to attach pmstat to an
           existing pmtime(1) instance via the IPC channel identified by the
           port argument.
           The -S, -T, -O and -A options may be used to define a time window
           to restrict the samples retrieved, set an initial origin within
           the time window, or specify a ``natural'' alignment of the sample
           times; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of these
           options.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a archive, --archive=archive
                Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
                Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log files identified by
                the archive argument, which is a comma-separated list of
                names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
                the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
           -A align, --align=align
                Force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a
                natural time unit align.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
                complete description of the syntax for align.
           -g, --guimode
                Start pmstat as the client of a new pmtime(1) server process
                for replay of archived performance data using the pmtime(1)
                graphical user interface.
           -h host, --host=host
                Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather than
                from the default localhost.
           -H path, --hostsfile=path
                Specify the path to a file containing a set of hostnames
                where pmcd(1) is running , rather than using the default
                localhost.
           -K spec, --spec-local=spec
                When fetching metrics from a local context (see -L), the -K
                option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
                made accessible.  The spec argument conforms to the syntax
                described in pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).  More than one -K option
                may be used.
           -l, --suffix
                Prints the last 7 characters of a hostname in summaries
                involving more than one host (when more than one -h option
                has been specified on the command line).
           -L, --local-PMDA
                Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the
                local host without PMCD.  See also -K.
           -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
                Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5))
                from the file pmnsfile.
           -O origin, --origin=origin
                When reporting archived metrics, start reporting at origin
                within the time window (see -S and -T).  Refer to
                PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the syntax for
                origin.
           -p port, --guiport=port
                Attach pmstat to an existing pmtime(1) time control process
                instance via the IPC channel identified by the port
                argument.  This option is normally only used by other tools,
                e.g.  pmchart(1), when they launch pmstat with synchronized
                time control.
           -P, --pause
                Pause between updates for archive replay.
           -s samples, --samples=samples
                The samples option defines the number of samples to be
                retrieved and reported.  If samples is 0 or -s is not
                specified, pmstat will sample and report continuously - this
                is the default behavior.
           -S starttime, --start=starttime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged at or after starttime.
                Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
                syntax for starttime.
           -t interval, --interval=interval
                Set the reporting interval to something other than the
                default 1 second.  The interval argument follows the syntax
                described in PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest form may be an
                unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are
                seconds).
           -T endtime, --finish=endtime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged before or at endtime.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -x, --xcpu
                The extended CPU metrics option, causes two additional CPU
                metrics to be reported, namely wait for I/O ("wa") and
                virtualisation steal time ("st").
           -z, --hostzone
                Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
                host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
                identified via either the -h or -a options.
           -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
                By default, pmtime reports the time of day according to the
                local timezone on the system where pmstat is run.  The -Z
                option changes the timezone to timezone in the format of the
                environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## OUTPUT         top
           The output from pmstat is directed to standard output, and the
           columns in the report are interpreted as follows:
           loadavg
                  The 1 minute load average.
           memory The swpd column indicates average swap space used during
                  the interval, in Kbytes.  The free column indicates
                  average free memory during the interval, in Kbytes.  The
                  buff column indicates average buffer memory in use during
                  the interval, in Kbytes.  The cache column indicates
                  average cached memory in use during the interval, in
                  Kbytes.
                  If the values become large, they are reported as Mbytes (m
                  suffix) or Gbytes (g suffix).
           swap   The metrics in this area of the kernel instrumentation are
                  of varying value.  We try to report the average number of
                  pages that are paged in (pi) and out (po) per second
                  during the interval.  If the corresponding page swapping
                  metrics are unavailable, we report the average rate per
                  second of swap operations in (si) and out (so) during the
                  interval.  It is normal for the ``in'' values to be non-
                  zero, but the system is suffering memory stress if the
                  ``out'' values are non-zero over an extended period.
                  If the values become large, they are reported as thousands
                  of operations per second (K suffix) or millions of
                  operations per second (M suffix).
           io     The bi and bo columns indicate the average rate per second
                  of block input and block output operations (respectfully)
                  during the interval.  Unless all file systems have a 1
                  Kbyte block size, these rates do not directly indicate
                  Kbytes transferred.
                  If the values become large, they are reported as thousands
                  of operations per second (K suffix) or millions of
                  operations per second (M suffix).
           system Interrupt rate (in) and context switch rate (cs).  Rates
                  are expressed as average operations per second during the
                  interval.  Note that the interrupt rate is normally at
                  least HZ (the clock interrupt rate, usually 100)
                  interrupts per second.
                  If the values become large, they are reported as thousands
                  of operations per second (K suffix) or millions of
                  operations per second (M suffix).
           cpu    Percentage of CPU time spent executing user and "nice
                  user" code (us), system and interrupt processing code
                  (sy), idle loop (id).
           If any values for the associated performance metrics are
           unavailable, the value appears as ``?'' in the output.

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
