## NAME         top
           pmdalmsensors - Linux hardware monitoring performance metrics
           domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors/pmdalmsensors [debug]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdalmsensors is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts performance metrics describing the state of hardware
           using the lm-sensors software on compatible motherboards.
           The lmsensors PMDA exports metrics that measure fan speeds and
           core temperatures.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           lmsensors performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors
                # ./Remove
           pmdalmsensors.python is usually launched by pmcd (1), and not
           executed directly. Direct execution is mostly used for debugging
           purposes.
           The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd (1) when the agent is
           installed or removed.
## OPTIONS         top
           pmdalmsensors.python supports the following options.
           -i, --inject
                  inject data from file instead of using sensors
           -d, --debug
                  debug level: 0 (default), 1 or 2
           -h, --help
                  show a help message
                  To use options while pmdalmsensors.python is run from
                  PMCD, you might want to use 'args' in the 'Install'
                  stript, for example
                  args="-i /path/static_sensors_output.txt"
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH
                  command line options used to launch pmdalmsensors
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors/help
                  default help text file for the lmsensors metrics
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors/Install
                  installation script for the pmdalmsensors agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lmsensors/Remove
                  undo installation script for the pmdalmsensors agent
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
