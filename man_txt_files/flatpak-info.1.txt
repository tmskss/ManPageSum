    FLATPAK INFO(1)               flatpak info               FLATPAK INFO(1)
## NAME         top
           flatpak-info - Show information about an installed application or
           runtime
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak info [OPTION...] NAME [BRANCH]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Show info about an installed application or runtime.
           By default, the output is formatted in a friendly format. If you
           specify any of the --show-...  or --file-access options, the
           output is instead formatted in a machine-readable format.
           By default, both per-user and system-wide installations are
           queried. Use the --user, --system or --installation options to
           change this.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -u, --user
               Query per-user installations.
           --system
               Query the default system-wide installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Query a system-wide installation by NAME among those defined
               in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --arch=ARCH
               Query for this architecture. See flatpak --supported-arches
               for architectures supported by the host.
           -r, --show-ref
               Show the installed ref.
           -o, --show-origin
               Show the remote the ref is installed from.
           -c, --show-commit
               Show the installed commit id.

               Show the installed size.
           -m, --show-metadata
               Show the metadata.

           -l, --show-location
               Show the on-disk location of the app or runtime. See the
               examples below.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
