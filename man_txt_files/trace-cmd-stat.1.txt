## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-stat - show the status of the tracing (ftrace) system
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd stat [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) stat displays the various status of the tracing
           (ftrace) system. The status that it shows is:
           Instances: List all configured ftrace instances.
           Tracer: if one of the tracers (like function_graph) is active.
           Otherwise nothing is displayed.
           Events: Lists the events that are enable.
           Event filters: Shows any filters that are set for any events
           Function filters: Shows any filters for the function tracers
           Graph functions: Shows any functions that the function graph
           tracer should graph
           Buffers: Shows the trace buffer size if they have been expanded.
           By default, tracing buffers are in a compressed format until they
           are used. If they are compressed, the buffer display will not be
           shown.
           Trace clock: If the tracing clock is anything other than the
           default "local" it will be displayed.
           Trace CPU mask: If not all available CPUs are in the tracing CPU
           mask, then the tracing CPU mask will be displayed.
           Trace max latency: Shows the value of the trace max latency if it
           is other than zero.
           Kprobes: Shows any kprobes that are defined for tracing.
           Uprobes: Shows any uprobes that are defined for tracing.
           Error log: Dump the content of ftrace error_log file.
## OPTIONS         top
           -B buffer-name
               Display the status of a given buffer instance. May be
               specified more than once to display the status of multiple
               instances.
           -t
               If -B is also specified, show the status of the top level
               tracing directory as well as the instance(s).
           -o
               Display the all the options along with their values. If they
               start with "no", then the option is disabled.
