    PMSEARCH(1)              General Commands Manual             PMSEARCH(1)
## NAME         top
           pmsearch - help text and names search for metrics, instances and
           instance domains
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmsearch [-CdinqsStTV?]  [-c config] [-h host] [-p port] [-N
           number] [-O offset] [query | indom]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmsearch performs full text search queries to find metrics using
           names and help text from metrics, instance domains and instances.
           It makes use of capabilties of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
           pmproxy(1) service, the Redis distributed data store, and the
           RediSearch module.
           Note that in order to use these services, it is mandatory that
           pmproxy is communicating with a redis-server(1) that has the
           redisearch.so module loaded.  When configured to do so, pmproxy
           will then automatically index PCP metric names, instance names,
           metric and instance domain help text into the RediSearch store,
           from PCP archives that it discovers locally.  Refer to
           pmlogger(1) and pmlogger_daily(1) for further details.
           By default pmsearch communicates with a local redis-server(1),
           however the -h and -p options can be used to specify an alternate
           Redis instance.  If this instance is a node of a Redis cluster,
           all other instances in the cluster will be discovered and used
           automatically.
## OPTIONS         top
           -c config, --config=config
                Specify the config file to use.
           -C, --no-colour
                No highlighting in results text.
           -d, --docid
                Report document ID of each search result.  Documents are
                identified using a unique SHA-1 hash which is always
                displayed in a 40-hexdigit human readable form.
           -h host, --host=host
                Connect to the Redis server at host, rather than the one the
                localhost.
           -i, --info
                Report search engine internal metrics.
           -n, --indom
                Perform an instance domain related entities search
           -N N, --number=N
                Return N, search results at most.
           -O N, --offset=N
                Paginated results from given offset.
           -p port, --port=port
                Connect to the Redis server at port, rather than the default
                6379.
           -q, --query
                Perform a general text search (default).
           -s, --suggest
                Peform a name suggestion search
           -S, --score
                Report score (rank) of each result.
           -T, --total
                Report total number of of search results.
           -t, --times
                Report elapsed search execution time.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## EXAMPLES         top
             $ pmsearch kernel idle
             Type: metric
             Name: kernel.all.cpu.idle
             One line: total idle CPU time from /proc/stat for all CPUs
             Type: metric
             Name: kernel.all.idletime
             One line: time the current kernel has been idle since boot
             Type: metric
             Name: kernel.percpu.cpu.idle
             InDom: 60.0
             One line: percpu idle CPU time metric from /proc/stat
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
