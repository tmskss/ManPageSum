## NAME         top
           namei - follow a pathname until a terminal point is found
## SYNOPSIS         top
           namei [options] pathname...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           namei interprets its arguments as pathnames to any type of Unix
           file (symlinks, files, directories, and so forth). namei then
           follows each pathname until an endpoint is found (a file, a
           directory, a device node, etc). If it finds a symbolic link, it
           shows the link, and starts following it, indenting the output to
           show the context.
           This program is useful for finding "too many levels of symbolic
           links" problems.
           For each line of output, namei uses the following characters to
           identify the file type found:
                  f: = the pathname currently being resolved
                   d = directory
                   l = symbolic link (both the link and its contents are output)
                   s = socket
                   b = block device
                   c = character device
                   p = FIFO (named pipe)
                   - = regular file
                   ? = an error of some kind
           namei prints an informative message when the maximum number of
           symbolic links this system can have has been exceeded.
## OPTIONS         top
           -l, --long
               Use the long listing format (same as -m -o -v).
           -m, --modes
               Show the mode bits of each file type in the style of ls(1),
               for example 'rwxr-xr-x'.
           -n, --nosymlinks
               Don’t follow symlinks.
           -o, --owners
               Show owner and group name of each file.
           -v, --vertical
               Vertically align the modes and owners.
           -x, --mountpoints
               Show mountpoint directories with a 'D' rather than a 'd'.
           -Z, --context
               Show security context of the file or "?" if not available.
               The support for security contexts is optional and does not
               have to be compiled to the namei binary.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
