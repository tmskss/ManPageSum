## NAME         top
           pmdahacluster - High Availability Cluster PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdahacluster is capable of collecting metric information to
           enable the monitoring of Pacemaker based HA Clusters through
           Performance Co-Pilot.
           The PMDA collects it's metric data from the following components
           that make up a Pacemkaer based HA Cluster: Pacemaker, Corosync,
           SBD, DRBD.
           For more detailed information regarding the metrics available
           please see the included pmns and helpfile with the PMDA.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install the HA Cluster PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/hacluster
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/hacluster
               # ./Remove
           pmdahacluster is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/hacluster/help
               default help text file for the HA Cluster metrics
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/hacluster/Install
               installation script for the pmdahacluster agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/hacluster/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdahacluster agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/hacluster.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdahacluster
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
