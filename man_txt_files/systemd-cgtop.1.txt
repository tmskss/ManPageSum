## NAME         top
           systemd-cgtop - Show top control groups by their resource usage
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-cgtop [OPTIONS...] [GROUP]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           systemd-cgtop shows the top control groups of the local Linux
           control group hierarchy, ordered by their CPU, memory, or disk
           I/O load. The display is refreshed in regular intervals (by
           default every 1s), similar in style to top(1). If a control group
           path is specified, shows only the services of the specified
           control group.
           If systemd-cgtop is not connected to a tty, no column headers are
           printed and the default is to only run one iteration. The
           --iterations= argument, if given, is honored. This mode is
           suitable for scripting.
           Resource usage is only accounted for control groups with the
           appropriate controllers turned on: "cpu" controller for CPU
           usage, "memory" controller for memory usage, and "io" controller
           for disk I/O consumption. If resource monitoring for these
           resources is required, it is recommended to add the
           CPUAccounting=1, MemoryAccounting=1 and IOAccounting=1 settings
           in the unit files in question. See systemd.resource-control(5)
           for details.
           The CPU load value can be between 0 and 100 times the number of
           processors the system has. For example, if the system has 8
           processors, the CPU load value is going to be between 0% and
           800%. The number of processors can be found in "/proc/cpuinfo".
           To emphasize: unless "CPUAccounting=1", "MemoryAccounting=1", and
           "IOAccounting=1" are enabled for the services in question, no
           resource accounting will be available for system services and the
           data shown by systemd-cgtop will be incomplete.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -p, --order=path
               Order by control group path name.
           -t, --order=tasks
               Order by number of tasks/processes in the control group.
           -c, --order=cpu
               Order by CPU load.
           -m, --order=memory
               Order by memory usage.
           -i, --order=io
               Order by disk I/O load.
           -b, --batch
               Run in "batch" mode: do not accept input and run until the
               iteration limit set with --iterations= is exhausted or until
               killed. This mode could be useful for sending output from
               systemd-cgtop to other programs or to a file.
           -r, --raw
               Format byte counts (as in memory usage and I/O metrics) and
               CPU time with raw numeric values rather than human-readable
               numbers.
           --cpu=percentage, --cpu=time
               Controls whether the CPU usage is shown as percentage or
               time. By default, the CPU usage is shown as percentage. This
               setting may also be toggled at runtime by pressing the % key.
           -P
               Count only userspace processes instead of all tasks. By
               default, all tasks are counted: each kernel thread and each
               userspace thread individually. With this setting, kernel
               threads are excluded from the counting and each userspace
               process only counts as one, regardless how many threads it
               consists of. This setting may also be toggled at runtime by
               pressing the P key. This option may not be combined with -k.
           -k
               Count only userspace processes and kernel threads instead of
               all tasks. By default, all tasks are counted: each kernel
               thread and each userspace thread individually. With this
               setting, kernel threads are included in the counting and each
               userspace process only counts as on one, regardless how many
               threads it consists of. This setting may also be toggled at
               runtime by pressing the k key. This option may not be
               combined with -P.
           --recursive=
               Controls whether the number of processes shown for a control
               group shall include all processes that are contained in any
               of the child control groups as well. Takes a boolean
               argument, which defaults to "yes". If enabled, the processes
               in child control groups are included, if disabled, only the
               processes in the control group itself are counted. This
               setting may also be toggled at runtime by pressing the r key.
               Note that this setting only applies to process counting, i.e.
               when the -P or -k options are used. It has not effect if all
               tasks are counted, in which case the counting is always
               recursive.
           -n, --iterations=
               Perform only this many iterations. A value of 0 indicates
               that the program should run indefinitely.
           -1
               A shortcut for --iterations=1.
           -d, --delay=
               Specify refresh delay in seconds (or if one of "ms", "us",
               "min" is specified as unit in this time unit). This setting
               may also be increased and decreased at runtime by pressing
               the + and - keys.
           --depth=
               Maximum control group tree traversal depth. Specifies how
               deep systemd-cgtop shall traverse the control group
               hierarchies. If 0 is specified, only the root group is
               monitored. For 1, only the first level of control groups is
               monitored, and so on. Defaults to 3.
           -M MACHINE, --machine=MACHINE
               Limit control groups shown to the part corresponding to the
               container MACHINE. This option may not be used when a control
               group path is specified.
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
## KEYS         top
           systemd-cgtop is an interactive tool and may be controlled via
           user input using the following keys:
           h
               Shows a short help text.
           Space
               Immediately refresh output.
           q
               Terminate the program.
           p, t, c, m, i
               Sort the control groups by path, number of tasks, CPU load,
               memory usage, or I/O load, respectively. This setting may
               also be controlled using the --order= command line switch.
           %
               Toggle between showing CPU time as time or percentage. This
               setting may also be controlled using the --cpu= command line
               switch.
           +, -
               Increase or decrease refresh delay, respectively. This
               setting may also be controlled using the --delay= command
               line switch.
           P
               Toggle between counting all tasks, or only userspace
               processes. This setting may also be controlled using the -P
               command line switch (see above).
           k
               Toggle between counting all tasks, or only userspace
               processes and kernel threads. This setting may also be
               controlled using the -k command line switch (see above).
           r
               Toggle between recursively including or excluding processes
               in child control groups in control group process counts. This
               setting may also be controlled using the --recursive= command
               line switch. This key is not available if all tasks are
               counted, it is only available if processes are counted, as
               enabled with the P or k keys.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
