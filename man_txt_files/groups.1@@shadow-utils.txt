    GROUPS(1)                     User Commands                    GROUPS(1)
## NAME         top
           groups - display current group names
## SYNOPSIS         top
           groups [user]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The groups command displays the current group names or ID values.
           If the value does not have a corresponding entry in /etc/group,
           the value will be displayed as the numerical group value. The
           optional user parameter will display the groups for the named
           user.
## NOTE         top
           Systems which do not support supplementary groups (see
           initgroups(3)) will have the information from /etc/group
           reported. The user must use newgrp or sg to change his current
           real and effective group ID.
## FILES         top
           /etc/group
               Group account information.
## SEE ALSO         top
           newgrp(1), getgid(2), getgroups(2), getuid(2), initgroups(3).
