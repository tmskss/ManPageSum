## NAME         top
           manconv - convert manual page from one encoding to another
## SYNOPSIS         top
           manconv -f [from-code[:from-code...]] -t to-code [-dqhV]
           [filename]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           manconv converts a manual page from one encoding to another, like
           iconv.  Unlike iconv, it can try multiple possible input
           encodings in sequence.  This is useful for manual pages installed
           in directories without an explicit encoding declaration, since
           they may be in UTF-8 or in a legacy character set.
           If an encoding declaration is found on the first line of the
           manual page, that declaration overrides any input encodings
           specified on manconv's command line.  Encoding declarations have
           the following form:
                  '\" -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
           or (if manual page preprocessors are also to be declared):
                  '\" t -*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-
## OPTIONS         top
           -f encodings, --from-code encodings
                  Try each of encodings (a colon-separated list) in sequence
                  as the input encoding.  The default is to guess likely
                  input encodings based on the file name.
           -t encoding, --to-code encoding
                  Convert the manual page to encoding.
           -q, --quiet
                  Do not issue error messages when the page cannot be
                  converted.
           -d, --debug
                  Print debugging information.
           -h, --help
                  Print a help message and exit.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information.
