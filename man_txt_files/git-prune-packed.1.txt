## NAME         top
           git-prune-packed - Remove extra objects that are already in pack
           files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git prune-packed [-n | --dry-run] [-q | --quiet]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This program searches the $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY for all objects
           that currently exist in a pack file as well as the independent
           object directories.
           All such extra objects are removed.
           A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with
           delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an
           associated index file.
           Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup
           engines, disk storage, etc.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --dry-run
               Don’t actually remove any objects, only show those that would
               have been removed.
           -q, --quiet
               Squelch the progress indicator.
