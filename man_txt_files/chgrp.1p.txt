    CHGRP(1P)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              CHGRP(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           chgrp — change the file group ownership
## SYNOPSIS         top
           chgrp [-h] group file...
           chgrp -R [-H|-L|-P] group file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The chgrp utility shall set the group ID of the file named by
           each file operand to the group ID specified by the group operand.
           For each file operand, or, if the -R option is used, each file
           encountered while walking the directory trees specified by the
           file operands, the chgrp utility shall perform actions equivalent
           to the chown() function defined in the System Interfaces volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, called with the following arguments:
            *  The file operand shall be used as the path argument.
            *  The user ID of the file shall be used as the owner argument.
            *  The specified group ID shall be used as the group argument.
           Unless chgrp is invoked by a process with appropriate privileges,
           the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of a regular file shall be
           cleared upon successful completion; the set-user-ID and set-
           group-ID bits of other file types may be cleared.
## OPTIONS         top
           The chgrp utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
           -h        For each file operand that names a file of type
                     symbolic link, chgrp shall attempt to set the group ID
                     of the symbolic link instead of the file referenced by
                     the symbolic link.
           -H        If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link
                     referencing a file of type directory is specified on
                     the command line, chgrp shall change the group of the
                     directory referenced by the symbolic link and all files
                     in the file hierarchy below it.
           -L        If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link
                     referencing a file of type directory is specified on
                     the command line or encountered during the traversal of
                     a file hierarchy, chgrp shall change the group of the
                     directory referenced by the symbolic link and all files
                     in the file hierarchy below it.
           -P        If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link is
                     specified on the command line or encountered during the
                     traversal of a file hierarchy, chgrp shall change the
                     group ID of the symbolic link. The chgrp utility shall
                     not follow the symbolic link to any other part of the
                     file hierarchy.
           -R        Recursively change file group IDs. For each file
                     operand that names a directory, chgrp shall change the
                     group of the directory and all files in the file
                     hierarchy below it. Unless a -H, -L, or -P option is
                     specified, it is unspecified which of these options
                     will be used as the default.
           Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options -H,
           -L, and -P shall not be considered an error. The last option
           specified shall determine the behavior of the utility.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           group     A group name from the group database or a numeric group
                     ID. Either specifies a group ID to be given to each
                     file named by one of the file operands. If a numeric
                     group operand exists in the group database as a group
                     name, the group ID number associated with that group
                     name is used as the group ID.
           file      A pathname of a file whose group ID is to be modified.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           chgrp:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    The utility executed successfully and all requested changes
                 were made.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           Only the owner of a file or the user with appropriate privileges
           may change the owner or group of a file.
           Some implementations restrict the use of chgrp to a user with
           appropriate privileges when the group specified is not the
           effective group ID or one of the supplementary group IDs of the
           calling process.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           The System V and BSD versions use different exit status codes.
           Some implementations used the exit status as a count of the
           number of errors that occurred; this practice is unworkable since
           it can overflow the range of valid exit status values. The
           standard developers chose to mask these by specifying only 0 and
           >0 as exit values.
           The functionality of chgrp is described substantially through
           references to chown().  In this way, there is no duplication of
           effort required for describing the interactions of permissions,
           multiple groups, and so on.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
