## NAME         top
           stg-pick - Import a patch from another branch or a commit object
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg pick [OPTIONS] <source>...
           stg pick [OPTIONS] [--name NAME] [--parent COMMITTISH] <source>
           stg pick [OPTIONS] --fold [--file PATH]... <source>...
           stg pick [OPTIONS] --update <source>...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Import one or more patches from another branch or commit object
           into the current series.
           By default, the imported patch’s name is reused, but may be
           overridden with the --name option. A commit object can be
           reverted with the --revert option.
           When using the --expose option, the format of the commit message
           is determined by the stgit.pick.expose-format configuration
           option. This option is a format string as may be supplied to the
           --pretty option of git-show(1). The default is
           "format:%B%n(imported from commit %H)", which appends the commit
           hash of the picked commit to the patch’s commit message.
## OPTIONS         top
           -B <branch>, --ref-branch=<branch>
               Pick patches from <branch>
           -r, --revert
               Revert the given commit object
           -x, --expose
               Append the imported commit id to the patch log
           --noapply
               Keep the imported patch unapplied
           -n <name>, --name=<name>
               Use <name> for the patch name
           -p <committish>, --parent=<committish>
               Use <committish> as parent
           --committer-date-is-author-date
               Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
               the author date of the commit as the committer date.
           --fold
               Fold the commit object into the current patch
           --update
               Like fold but only update the current patch’s files
           -f <path>, --file=<path>
               Only fold the given file (may be used multiple times)
