    QSIG(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               QSIG(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           qsig — signal batch jobs
## SYNOPSIS         top
           qsig [-s signal] job_identifier...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           To signal a batch job is to send a signal to the session leader
           of the batch job. A batch job is signaled by sending a request to
           the batch server that manages the batch job. The qsig utility is
           a user-accessible batch client that requests the signaling of a
           batch job.
           The qsig utility shall signal those batch jobs for which a batch
           job_identifier is presented to the utility. The qsig utility
           shall not signal any batch jobs whose batch job_identifiers are
           not presented to the utility.
           The qsig utility shall signal batch jobs in the order in which
           the corresponding batch job_identifiers are presented to the
           utility. If the qsig utility fails to process a batch
           job_identifier successfully, the utility shall proceed to process
           the remaining batch job_identifiers, if any.
           The qsig utility shall signal batch jobs by sending a Signal Job
           Request to the batch server that manages the batch job.
           For each successfully processed batch job_identifier, the qsig
           utility shall have received a completion reply to each Signal Job
           Request sent to a batch server at the time the utility exits.
## OPTIONS         top
           The qsig utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following option shall be supported by the implementation:
           -s signal Define the signal to be sent to the batch job.
                     The qsig utility shall accept a signal option-argument
                     that is either a symbolic signal name or an unsigned
                     integer signal number (see the POSIX.1‐1990 standard,
                     Section 3.3.1.1). The qsig utility shall accept signal
                     names for which the SIG prefix has been omitted.
                     If the signal option-argument is a signal name, the
                     qsig utility shall send that name.
                     If the signal option-argument is a number, the qsig
                     utility shall send the signal value represented by the
                     number.
                     If the -s option is not presented to the qsig utility,
                     the utility shall send the signal SIGTERM to each
                     signaled batch job.
## OPERANDS         top
           The qsig utility shall accept one or more operands that conform
           to the syntax for a batch job_identifier (see Section 3.3.1,
           Batch Job Identifier).
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           qsig:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           LOGNAME   Determine the login name of the user.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           An implementation of the qsig utility may write informative
           messages to standard output.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           In addition to the default behavior, the qsig utility shall not
           be required to write a diagnostic message to standard error when
           the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the
           batch job_identifier does not exist on the server. Whether or not
           the qsig utility waits to output the diagnostic message while
           attempting to locate the batch job on other servers is
           implementation-defined.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           The qsig utility allows users to signal batch jobs.
           A user may be unable to signal a batch job with the kill utility
           of the operating system for a number of reasons. First, the
           process ID of the batch job may be unknown to the user. Second,
           the processes of the batch job may be on a remote node. However,
           by virtue of communication between batch nodes, the qsig utility
           can arrange for the signaling of a process.
           Because a batch job that is not running cannot be signaled, and
           because the signal may not terminate the batch job, the qsig
           utility is not a substitute for the qdel utility.
           The options of the qsig utility allow the user to specify the
           signal that is to be sent to the batch job.
           The -s option allows users to specify a signal by name or by
           number, and thus override the default signal. The POSIX.1‐1990
           standard defines signals by both name and number.
           The qsig utility is a new utility, vis-a-vis existing practice;
           it has been defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 in response to
           user-perceived shortcomings in existing practice.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           The qsig utility may be removed in a future version.
