## NAME         top
           pmdasockets - sockets statistics PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdasockets is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values for current sockets on the local system.
           This PMDA currently collects its data through the ss(8) utility
           and requires that the program is installed in order to function.
           This dependency may change in the future.
## INSTALLATION         top
           To install (enable) the sockets PMDA, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sockets
               # ./Install
           To uninstall (disable), do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sockets
               # ./Remove
           pmdasockets is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILTER CONFIGURATION         top
           The string valued metric network.persocket.filter specifies the
           ss(1) filter to be applied to optionally select socket states, IP
           addresses and other options that pmdasockets will collect (to
           populate it's instance domain).  This is loaded on PMDA startup
           from the file $(PCP_SYSCONF_DIR)/sockets/filter.conf (typically
           /etc/pcp/sockets/filter.conf) and defaults to state connected
           meaning only sockets in the connected state will be included.
           This can be changed persistently by editing filter.conf as the
           root user.  The filter can also be changed dynamically after the
           PMDA has started by using pmstore(1) to store a new filter string
           in the network.persocket.filter metric.  E.g.
               # pmstore network.persocket.filter "state all"
           will change the filter to include sockets in all states.  Note a
           dynamically stored filter is not persisted across PMDA restarts
           or reboots (edit the config file for a persistent change).  For
           further details of the filter syntax and options, consult ss(8).
## LOGGING CONFIGURATION         top
           The pmlogconf(1) configuration file for pmdasockets is
           $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf/networking/persocket-linux (where
           $PCP_VAR_DIR is typically /var/lib/pcp) which specifies to log
           all metrics below network.persocket in the PCP namespace with a
           default sampling interval of 60 seconds.  The logging interval
           and metrics to be logged can be changed by editing that file and
           then restarting the pmlogger service.  For details of the syntax,
           see pmlogconf(1).
## METRICS         top
           The metrics and metadata supported by pmdasockets correspond to
           fields reported by ss -noemitauOH and are also available as help
           text provided by the PMDA, e.g. to list all metrics, metadata
           descriptors and help text:
               # pminfo -fmdtT network.persocket
           Note that the PMDA must be installed (enabled) for this command
           to work correctly, see above.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
