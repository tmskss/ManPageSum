## NAME         top
           pmdaapache - Apache2 web server performance metrics domain agent
           (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache/pmdaapache [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-U
           username] [-S server] [-P port] [-L location]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdaapache is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts performance metrics describing the state of an Apache
           web server.
           The apache PMDA exports metrics that measure the request rate,
           cumulative request sizes, uptime and various connection states
           for active clients.
           This information is obtained by performing a HTTP request to the
           server status URL, which must be enabled in the httpd.conf
           configuration file.
                ExtendedStatus on
                <Location /server-status>
                SetHandler server-status
                Order deny,allow
                Deny from all
                Allow from localhost
                </Location>
           A brief description of the pmdaapache command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                apache.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdaapache is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .  If
                the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -S   Query the Apache status information from the named server
                rather than the local host.
           -P   Query the Apache status information from the given port
                rather than the default (80).
           -L   Specify an alternative location for finding the server-
                status page.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           apache performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/apache
                # ./Remove
           pmdaapache is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdaapache
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
