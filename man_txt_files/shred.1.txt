## NAME         top
           shred - overwrite a file to hide its contents, and optionally
           delete it
## SYNOPSIS         top
           shred [OPTION]... FILE...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly, in order to make it
           harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the
           data.
           If FILE is -, shred standard output.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -f, --force
                  change permissions to allow writing if necessary
           -n, --iterations=N
                  overwrite N times instead of the default (3)
           --random-source=FILE
                  get random bytes from FILE
           -s, --size=N
                  shred this many bytes (suffixes like K, M, G accepted)
           -u     deallocate and remove file after overwriting
           --remove[=HOW]
                  like -u but give control on HOW to delete;  See below
           -v, --verbose
                  show progress
           -x, --exact
                  do not round file sizes up to the next full block;
                  this is the default for non-regular files
           -z, --zero
                  add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           Delete FILE(s) if --remove (-u) is specified.  The default is not
           to remove the files because it is common to operate on device
           files like /dev/hda, and those files usually should not be
           removed.  The optional HOW parameter indicates how to remove a
           directory entry: 'unlink' => use a standard unlink call.  'wipe'
           => also first obfuscate bytes in the name.  'wipesync' => also
           sync each obfuscated byte to the device.  The default mode is
           'wipesync', but note it can be expensive.
           CAUTION: shred assumes the file system and hardware overwrite
           data in place.  Although this is common, many platforms operate
           otherwise.  Also, backups and mirrors may contain unremovable
           copies that will let a shredded file be recovered later.  See the
           GNU coreutils manual for details.
