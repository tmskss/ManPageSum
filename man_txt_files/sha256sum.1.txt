    SHA256SUM(1)                  User Commands                 SHA256SUM(1)
## NAME         top
           sha256sum - compute and check SHA256 message digest
## SYNOPSIS         top
           sha256sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Print or check SHA256 (256-bit) checksums.
           With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
           -b, --binary
                  read in binary mode
           -c, --check
                  read checksums from the FILEs and check them
           --tag  create a BSD-style checksum
           -t, --text
                  read in text mode (default)
           -z, --zero
                  end each output line with NUL, not newline, and disable
                  file name escaping
       The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
           --ignore-missing
                  don't fail or report status for missing files
           --quiet
                  don't print OK for each successfully verified file
           --status
                  don't output anything, status code shows success
           --strict
                  exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
           -w, --warn
                  warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-2.  When checking,
           the input should be a former output of this program.  The default
           mode is to print a line with: checksum, a space, a character
           indicating input mode ('*' for binary, ' ' for text or where
           binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.
           Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on
           GNU systems.
