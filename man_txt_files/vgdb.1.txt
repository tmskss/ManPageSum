## NAME         top
           vgdb - intermediary between Valgrind and GDB or a shell
## SYNOPSIS         top
           vgdb [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           vgdb ("Valgrind to GDB") is used as an intermediary between
           Valgrind and GDB or a shell. It has three usage modes:
            1. As a standalone utility, it is used from a shell command line
               to send monitor commands to a process running under Valgrind.
               For this usage, the vgdb OPTION(s) must be followed by the
               monitor command to send. To send more than one command,
               separate them with the -c option.
            2. In combination with GDB "target remote |" command, it is used
               as the relay application between GDB and the Valgrind
               gdbserver. For this usage, only OPTION(s) can be given, but
               no COMMAND can be given.
            3. In the --multi mode, vgdb uses the extended remote protocol
               to communicate with GDB. This allows you to view output from
               both valgrind and GDB in the GDB session. This is
               accomplished via the "target extended-remote | vgdb --multi".
               In this mode you no longer need to start valgrind yourself.
               vgdb will start up valgrind when gdb tells it to run a new
               program. For this usage, the vgdb OPTIONS(s) can also include
               --valgrind and --vargs to describe how valgrind should be
               started.
## OPTIONS         top
           --pid=<number>
               Specifies the PID of the process to which vgdb must connect
               to. This option is useful in case more than one Valgrind
               gdbserver can be connected to. If the --pid argument is not
               given and multiple Valgrind gdbserver processes are running,
               vgdb will report the list of such processes and then exit.
           --vgdb-prefix
               Must be given to both Valgrind and vgdb if you want to change
               the default prefix for the FIFOs (named pipes) used for
               communication between the Valgrind gdbserver and vgdb.
           --wait=<number>
               Instructs vgdb to search for available Valgrind gdbservers
               for the specified number of seconds. This makes it possible
               start a vgdb process before starting the Valgrind gdbserver
               with which you intend the vgdb to communicate. This option is
               useful when used in conjunction with a --vgdb-prefix that is
               unique to the process you want to wait for. Also, if you use
               the --wait argument in the GDB "target remote" command, you
               must set the GDB remotetimeout to a value bigger than the
               --wait argument value. See option --max-invoke-ms (just
               below) for an example of setting the remotetimeout value.
           --max-invoke-ms=<number>
               Gives the number of milliseconds after which vgdb will force
               the invocation of gdbserver embedded in Valgrind. The default
               value is 100 milliseconds. A value of 0 disables forced
               invocation. The forced invocation is used when vgdb is
               connected to a Valgrind gdbserver, and the Valgrind process
               has all its threads blocked in a system call.
               If you specify a large value, you might need to increase the
               GDB "remotetimeout" value from its default value of 2
               seconds. You should ensure that the timeout (in seconds) is
               bigger than the --max-invoke-ms value. For example, for
               --max-invoke-ms=5000, the following GDB command is suitable:
                       (gdb) set remotetimeout 6
           --cmd-time-out=<number>
               Instructs a standalone vgdb to exit if the Valgrind gdbserver
               it is connected to does not process a command in the
               specified number of seconds. The default value is to never
               time out.
           --port=<portnr>
               Instructs vgdb to use tcp/ip and listen for GDB on the
               specified port nr rather than to use a pipe to communicate
               with GDB. Using tcp/ip allows to have GDB running on one
               computer and debugging a Valgrind process running on another
               target computer. Example:
                   # On the target computer, start your program under valgrind using
                   valgrind --vgdb-error=0 prog
                   # and then in another shell, run:
                   vgdb --port=1234
               On the computer which hosts GDB, execute the command:
                   gdb prog
                   (gdb) target remote targetip:1234
               where targetip is the ip address or hostname of the target
               computer.
           --vgdb-multi
               Makes vgdb start in extended-remote mode and to wait for gdb
               to tell us what to run.
           --valgrind
               The path to valgrind to use, in extended-remote mode. If not
               specified, the system valgrind will be launched.
           --vargs
               Options to run valgrind with, in extended-remote mode. For
               example -q. Everything following --vargs will be provided as
               arguments to valgrind as is.
           -c
               To give more than one command to a standalone vgdb, separate
               the commands by an option -c. Example:
                   vgdb v.set log_output -c leak_check any
           -l
               Instructs a standalone vgdb to report the list of the
               Valgrind gdbserver processes running and then exit.
           -T
               Instructs vgdb to add timestamps to vgdb information
               messages.
           -D
               Instructs a standalone vgdb to show the state of the shared
               memory used by the Valgrind gdbserver. vgdb will exit after
               having shown the Valgrind gdbserver shared memory state.
           -d
               Instructs vgdb to produce debugging output. Give multiple -d
               args to increase the verbosity. When giving -d to a relay
               vgdb, you better redirect the standard error (stderr) of vgdb
               to a file to avoid interaction between GDB and vgdb debugging
               output.
