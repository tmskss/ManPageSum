## DESCRIPTION         top
           The sadf command is used for displaying the contents of data
           files created by the sar(1) command. But unlike sar, sadf can
           write its data in many different formats (CSV, XML, etc.)  The
           default format is one that can easily be handled by pattern
           processing commands like awk (see option -p). The sadf command
           can also be used to draw graphs for the various activities
           collected by sar and display them as SVG (Scalable Vector
           Graphics) graphics in your web browser (see option -g).
           The sadf command extracts and writes to standard output records
           saved in the datafile file. This file must have been created by a
           version of sar which is compatible with that of sadf. If datafile
           is omitted, sadf uses the standard system activity daily data
           file.  It is also possible to enter -1, -2 etc. as an argument to
           sadf to display data of that days ago. For example, -1 will point
           at the standard system activity file of yesterday.
           The standard system activity daily data file is named saDD or
           saYYYYMMDD, where YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the
           current month and DD for the current day.  sadf will look for the
           most recent of saDD and saYYYYMMDD, and use it. By default it is
           located in the /var/log/sa directory. Yet it is possible to
           specify an alternate location for it: If datafile is a directory
           (instead of a plain file) then it will be considered as the
           directory where the standard system activity daily data file is
           located.
           The interval and count parameters are used to tell sadf to select
           count records at interval seconds apart. If the count parameter
           is not set, then all the records saved in the data file will be
           displayed.
           All the activity flags of sar may be entered on the command line
           to indicate which activities are to be reported. Before
           specifying them, put a pair of dashes (--) on the command line in
           order not to confuse the flags with those of sadf.  Not
           specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.
## OPTIONS         top
           -C     Tell sadf to display comments present in file.
           -c     Convert an old system activity binary datafile (version
                  9.1.6 and later) to current up-to-date format. Use the
                  following syntax:
                  sadf -c old_datafile > new_datafile
                  Conversion can be controlled using option -O (see below).
           -d     Print the contents of the data file in a format that can
                  easily be ingested by a relational database system. The
                  output consists of fields separated by a semicolon. Each
                  record contains the hostname of the host where the file
                  was created, the interval value (or -1 if not applicable),
                  the timestamp in a form easily acceptable by most
                  databases, and additional semicolon separated data fields
                  as specified by sar_options command line options.  Note
                  that timestamp output can be controlled by options -T, -t
                  and -U.
           --dev=dev_list
                  Specify the block devices for which statistics are to be
                  displayed by sadf.  dev_list is a list of comma-separated
                  device names. Useful with option -d from sar.
           -e [ hh:mm[:ss] ]
           -e [ seconds_since_the_epoch ]
                  Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time
                  is 18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format, or as
                  the number of seconds since the epoch (given as a 10 digit
                  number).
           --fs=fs_list
                  Specify the filesystems for which statistics are to be
                  displayed by sadf.  fs_list is a list of comma-separated
                  filesystem names or mountpoints. Useful with option -F
                  from sar.
           -g     Print the contents of the data file in SVG (Scalable
                  Vector Graphics) format.  This option enables you to
                  display some fancy graphs in your web browser.  Use the
                  following syntax:
                  sadf -g your_datafile [ -- sar_options ] > output.svg
                  and open the resulting SVG file in your favorite web
                  browser.  Output can be controlled using option -O (see
                  below).
           -H     Display only the header of the report (when applicable).
                  If no format has been specified, then the header data
                  (metadata) of the data file are displayed.
           -h     When used in conjunction with option -d, all activities
                  will be displayed horizontally on a single line.
           --iface=iface_list
                  Specify the network interfaces for which statistics are to
                  be displayed by sadf.  iface_list is a list of comma-
                  separated interface names. Useful with options -n DEV and
                  -n EDEV from sar.
           --int=int_list
                  Specify the interrupts names for which statistics are to
                  be displayed by sadf.  int_list is a list of comma-
                  separated values or range of values (e.g., 0-16,35,40-).
                  Useful with option -I from sar.
           -j     Print the contents of the data file in JSON (JavaScript
                  Object Notation) format. Timestamps can be controlled by
                  options -T and -t.
           -l     Export the contents of the data file to a PCP (Performance
                  Co-Pilot) archive.  The name of the archive can be
                  specified using the keyword pcparchive= with option -O.
           -O opts[,...]
                  Use the specified options to control the output of sadf.
                  The following options are used to control SVG output
                  displayed by sadf -g:
                  autoscale
                         Draw all the graphs of a given view as large as
                         possible based on current view's scale. To do this,
                         a factor (10, 100, 1000...) is used to enlarge the
                         graph drawing.  This option may be interesting when
                         several graphs are drawn on the same view, some
                         with only very small values, and others with high
                         ones, the latter making the former hardly visible.
                  bwcol  Use a black and white palette to draw the graphs.
                  customcol
                         Use a customizable color palette instead of the
                         default one to draw the graphs. See environment
                         variable S_COLORS_PALETTE below to know how to
                         customize that palette.
                  debug  Add helpful comments in SVG output file.
                  height=value
                         Set SVG canvas height to value.
                  oneday Display graphs data over a period of 24 hours. Note
                         that hours are still printed in UTC by default: You
                         should use option -T to print them in local time
                         and get a time window starting from midnight.
                  packed Group all views from the same activity (and for the
                         same device) on the same row.
                  showidle
                         Also display %idle state in graphs for CPU
                         statistics.
                  showinfo
                         Display additional information (such as the date
                         and the host name) on each view.
                  showtoc
                         Add a table of contents at the beginning of the SVG
                         output, consisting of links pointing at the first
                         graph of each activity.
                  skipempty
                         Do not display views where all graphs have only
                         zero values.
                  The following option may be used when converting an old
                  system activity binary datafile to current up-to-date
                  format:
                  hz=value
                         Specify the number of ticks per second for the
                         machine where the old datafile has been created.
                  The following option may be used when data are exported to
                  a PCP archive:
                  pcparchive=name
                         Specify the name of the PCP archive to create.
                  The following option is used to control raw output
                  displayed by sadf -r:
                  debug  Display additional information, mainly useful for
                         debugging purpose.
           -P { cpu_list | ALL }
                  Tell sadf that processor dependent statistics are to be
                  reported only for the specified processor or processors.
                  cpu_list is a list of comma-separated values or range of
                  values (e.g., 0,2,4-7,12-).  Note that processor 0 is the
                  first processor, and processor all is the global average
                  among all processors. Specifying the ALL keyword reports
                  statistics for each individual processor, and globally for
                  all processors.
           -p     Print the contents of the data file in a format that can
                  easily be handled by pattern processing commands like awk.
                  The output consists of fields separated by a tab. Each
                  record contains the hostname of the host where the file
                  was created, the interval value (or -1 if not applicable),
                  the timestamp, the device name (or - if not applicable),
                  the field name and its value.  Note that timestamp output
                  can be controlled by options -T, -t and -U.
           -r     Print the raw contents of the data file. With this format,
                  the values for all the counters are displayed as read from
                  the kernel, which means e.g., that no average values are
                  calculated over the elapsed time interval.  Output can be
                  controlled using option -O (see above).
           -s [ hh:mm[:ss] ]
           -s [ seconds_since_the_epoch ]
                  Set the starting time of the data, causing the sadf
                  command to extract records time-tagged at, or following,
                  the time specified. The default starting time is 08:00:00.
                  Hours must be given in 24-hour format, or as the number of
                  seconds since the epoch (given as a 10 digit number).
           -T     Display timestamp in local time instead of UTC
                  (Coordinated Universal Time).
           -t     Display timestamp in the original local time of the data
                  file creator instead of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
           -U     Display timestamp (UTC - Coordinated Universal Time) in
                  seconds from the epoch.
           -V     Print version number then exit.
           -x     Print the contents of the data file in XML format.
                  Timestamps can be controlled by options -T and -t.  The
                  corresponding DTD (Document Type Definition) and XML
                  Schema are included in the sysstat source package. They
                  are also available at https://sysstat.github.io/ .
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           The sadf command takes into account the following environment
           variables:
           S_COLORS_PALETTE
                  Specify the colors used by sadf -g to render the SVG
                  output. This environment variable is taken into account
                  only when the custom color palette has been selected with
                  the option customcol (see option -O).  Its value is a
                  colon-separated list of capabilities associated with six-
                  digit, three-byte hexadecimal numbers (hex triplets)
                  representing colors that defaults to
                  0=000000:1=1a1aff:2=1affb2:3=b21aff:
                  4=1ab2ff:5=ff1a1a:6=ffb31a:7=b2ff1a:
                  8=efefef:9=000000:A=1a1aff:B=1affb2:
                  C=b21aff:D=1ab2ff:E=ff1a1a:F=ffb31a:
                  G=bebebe:H=000000:I=000000:K=ffffff:
                  L=000000:T=000000:W=000000:X=000000
                  Capabilities consisting of a hexadecimal digit (0 through
                  F) are used to specify the first sixteen colors in the
                  palette (these colors are used to draw the graphs), e.g.,
                  3=ffffff would indicate that the third color in the
                  palette is white (0xffffff).
                  Other capabilities are:
                  G=     Specify the color used to draw the grid lines.
                  H=     Specify the color used to display the report
                         header.
                  I=     Specify the color used to display additional
                         information (e.g., date, hostname...)
                  K=     Specify the color used for the graphs background.
                  L=     Specify the default color (which is for example
                         used to display the table of contents).
                  T=     Specify the color used to display the graphs title.
                  W=     Specify the color used to display warning and error
                         messages.
                  X=     Specify the color used to draw the axes and display
                         the graduations.
           S_TIME_DEF_TIME
                  If this variable exists and its value is UTC then sadf
                  will use UTC time instead of local time to determine the
                  current daily data file located in the /var/log/sa
                  directory.
## EXAMPLES         top
           sadf -d /var/log/sa/sa21 -- -r -n DEV
                  Extract memory and network statistics from system activity
                  file sa21, and display them in a format that can be
                  ingested by a database.
           sadf -p -P 1
                  Extract CPU statistics for processor 1 (the second
                  processor) from current daily data file, and display them
                  in a format that can easily be handled by a pattern
                  processing command.
## BUGS         top
           SVG output (as created by option -g) is fully compliant with SVG
           1.1 standard.  Graphics have been successfully displayed in
           various web browsers, including Firefox, Chrome and Opera. Yet
           SVG rendering is broken on Microsoft browsers (tested on Internet
           Explorer 11 and Edge 13.1): So please don't use them.
## FILES         top
           /var/log/sa/saDD
           /var/log/sa/saYYYYMMDD
                  The standard system activity daily data files and their
                  default location.  YYYY stands for the current year, MM
                  for the current month and DD for the current day.
