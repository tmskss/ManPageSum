## NAME         top
           pmlogger_daily_report - write Performance Co-Pilot daily summary
           reports
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily_report [-ApV?]  [-a archivefile]
           [-f outputfile] [-h hostname] [-l logfile] [-o directory] [-t
           interval]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmlogger_daily_report writes daily performance summary reports,
           much like those produced by sadc(1) and the sa2(8) utility.
           All of the command line arguments are optional and intended to be
           self explanatory.
           By default, the reports are not generated, but if the pcp-
           zeroconf package has been installed (there will be files in
           $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf/zeroconf) then the necessary
           metrics will have been included in the default pmlogger(1)
           configuration file and the reports will be generated.
           The reports are generated (by default) soon after midnight, once
           pmlogger_daily(1) has completed the merging of any partal
           archives to generate one archive for yesterday's activity.
           Each performance summary report is named sarXX (where XX is
           yesterdays day-of-the-month).  The outputfile may be changed with
           the -f option.  The report will be written to the $PCP_LOG_DIR/sa
           directory by default, but this may be changed with the -o option
           to a different directory.
           Note that there are suffciently flexible command line options for
           pmlogger_daily_report to be used to read any archivefile and
           write the report to any output directory.
           If the -a option is not given, the default input archivefile is
           $PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/HOSTNAME/YYYYMMDD, where HOSTNAME defaults to
           the local hostname (unless changed with the -h option) and
           YYYYMMDD is the base name of yesterdays merged archive, as
           produced by pmlogger(1) and pmlogger_daily(1).  If archivefile is
           a directory, then pmlogger_daily_report will use all PCP archives
           found in that directory to write the report (this is known as
           multi-archive mode, and may be considerably slower than
           specifying a single archive as the input).
           The reports themselves are created by the pmrep(1) utility using
           its default configuration file, see pmrep.conf(5).  The pmrep(1)
           configuration entries used to write the reports is currently
           hardwired into the pmlogger_daily_report script.
           Finally, the input archives must contain sufficient metrics as
           needed by pmrep(1) to write the report.  On platforms that
           support it, the pcp-zeroconf package configures PCP logging as
           required for this - hence pmlogger_daily_report should be used
           with the pmlogger(1) configuration that is set up by pcp-
           zeroconf.  As the name suggests, pcp-zeroconf requires no
           additional configuration after installation in order to capture
           the required archives needed by pmlogger_daily_report.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a archive
                Specifies an alternate input archive file basename or
                directory path.
           -A   Use the start and end times of input archive for the report,
                as opposed to the default behaviour of 24 hours from
                midnight yesterday.
           -f filename
                Specifies an alternate output filename.  -h hostname
                Specifies an alternateA hostname to use within the default
                input archive file path.
           -l file, --logfile=file
                In order to ensure that mail is not unintentionally sent
                when this script is run from pmlogger_daily(1) diagnostics
                are always sent to a log file.  By default, this file is
                $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger_daily_report.log but this can
                be changed using the -l option.  If this log file already
                exists when the script starts, it will be renamed with a
                .prev suffix (overwriting any log file saved earlier) before
                diagnostics are generated to the log file.
           -p   If this option is specified then the status of the daily
                processing is polled and if the report has not been done in
                the last 24 hours then it is done now.  With this option,
                pmlogger_daily_report simply exits if the previous day's
                processing has already been done.
                This option is no longer required as the polling of
                pmlogger_daily(1) will ensure the report will be generated,
                however the option is retained for backwards compatibility.
           -t interval
                Specifies the sampling interval used when generating the
                report, in the format described in PCPIntro(1).  The default
                is every 10 minutes.
           -V, --verbose
                The output from the execution of the script may be extended
                using this option which enables verbose tracing of activity.
                By default the script generates no log output unless some
                error or warning condition is encountered.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
