## NAME         top
           ldappasswd - change the password of an LDAP entry
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ldappasswd [-V[V]] [-d debuglevel] [-n] [-v] [-A] [-a oldPasswd]
           [-t oldpasswdfile] [-S] [-s newPasswd] [-T newpasswdfile] [-x]
           [-D binddn] [-W] [-w passwd] [-y passwdfile] [-H ldapuri]
           [-e [!]ext[=extparam]] [-E [!]ext[=extparam]] [-o opt[=optparam]]
           [-O security-properties] [-I] [-Q] [-N] [-U authcid] [-R realm]
           [-X authzid] [-Y mech] [-Z[Z]] [user]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ldappasswd is a tool to set the password of an LDAP user.
           ldappasswd uses the LDAPv3 Password Modify (RFC 3062) extended
           operation.
           ldappasswd sets the password of associated with the user [or an
           optionally specified user].  If the new password is not specified
           on the command line and the user doesn't enable prompting, the
           server will be asked to generate a password for the user.
           ldappasswd is neither designed nor intended to be a replacement
           for passwd(1) and should not be installed as such.
## OPTIONS         top
           -V[V]  Print version info.  If -VV is given, only the version
                  information is printed.
           -d debuglevel
                  Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldappasswd
                  must be compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option
                  to have any effect.
           -n     Do not set password. (Can be useful when used in
                  conjunction with -v or -d)
           -v     Increase the verbosity of output.  Can be specified
                  multiple times.
           -A     Prompt for old password.  This is used instead of
                  specifying the password on the command line.
           -a oldPasswd
                  Set the old password to oldPasswd.
           -t oldPasswdFile
                  Set the old password to the contents of oldPasswdFile.
           -S     Prompt for new password.  This is used instead of
                  specifying the password on the command line.
           -s newPasswd
                  Set the new password to newPasswd.
           -T newPasswdFile
                  Set the new password to the contents of newPasswdFile.
           -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.
           -D binddn
                  Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP
                  directory.  For SASL binds, the server is expected to
                  ignore this value.
           -W     Prompt for bind password.  This is used instead of
                  specifying the password on the command line.
           -w passwd
                  Use passwd as the password to bind with.
           -y passwdfile
                  Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for
                  simple authentication.
           -H ldapuri
                  Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the
                  protocol/host/port fields are allowed; a list of URI,
                  separated by whitespace or commas is expected.
           -e [!]ext[=extparam]
           -E [!]ext[=extparam]
                  Specify general extensions with -e and passwd modify
                  extensions with -E.  ´!´ indicates criticality.
                  General extensions:
                    [!]assert=<filter>    (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                    !authzid=<authzid>    ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                    [!]bauthzid           (RFC 3829 authzid control)
                    [!]chaining[=<resolve>[/<cont>]]
                    [!]manageDSAit
                    [!]noop
                    ppolicy
                    [!]postread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                    [!]preread[=<attrs>]  (a comma-separated attribute list)
                    [!]relax
                    sessiontracking[=<username>]
                    abandon,cancel,ignore (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel,
                    or ignores response; if critical, doesn't wait for SIGINT.
                    not really controls)
                  Passwd Modify extensions:
                    (none)
           -o opt[=optparam]]
                  Specify any ldap.conf(5) option or one of the following:
                    nettimeout=<timeout>  (in seconds, or "none" or "max")
                    ldif_wrap=<width>     (in columns, or "no" for no wrapping)
           -O security-properties
                  Specify SASL security properties.
           -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is
                  to prompt only as needed.
           -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.
           -N     Do not use reverse DNS to canonicalize SASL host name.
           -U authcid
                  Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
                  the ID depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.
           -R realm
                  Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The
                  form of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism
                  used.
           -X authzid
                  Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.
                  authzid must be one of the following formats:
                  dn:<distinguished name> or u:<username>.
           -Y mech
                  Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication.
                  If it's not specified, the program will choose the best
                  mechanism the server knows.
           -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended
                  operation. If you use -ZZ, the command will require the
                  operation to be successful
