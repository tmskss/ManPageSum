## NAME         top
           stg-branch - Branch operations: switch, list, create, rename,
           delete, ...
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg branch
           stg branch [--merge] <branch>
           stg branch {--list,-l}
           stg branch {--create,-c} <new-branch> [committish]
           stg branch --clone [new-branch]
           stg branch {--rename,-r} [old-name] <new-name>
           stg branch {--protect,-p} [branch]
           stg branch {--unprotect,-u} [branch]
           stg branch --delete [--force] <branch>
           stg branch --cleanup [--force] [branch]
           stg branch {--describe,-d} <description> [branch]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Create, clone, switch, rename, or delete StGit-enabled branches.
           With no arguments, the current branch is printed to stdout.
           With a single argument, switch to the named branch.
           StGit supports specifying a branch using the @{-<n>} syntax
           supported by git, including - as a synonym for @{-1}. Thus stg
           branch - may be used to switch to the last checked-out HEAD. Note
           that @{-<n>} refers to the <n>th last HEAD, which is not
           necessarily a local branch. Using an @{-<n>} value that refers to
           anything but a local branch will result in an error.
## COMMANDS         top
           --list
               List each branch in the current repository along with its
               description, if any. The current branch is prefixed with >.
               Branches initialized with StGit stacks are prefixed with s.
               Protected branches are prefixed with p.
           --create
               Create and switch to a new branch. The new branch is
               initialized as a StGit patch stack. The new branch will be
               based on the current HEAD, by default, unless an optional
               committish provided for the base.
               StGit attempts to detect the branch from which the new branch
               forked, as well as the remote repository of that parent
               branch such that stg-pull(1) will pull from the correct
               remote branch. A warning will be printed if the parent branch
               cannot be determined.
           --clone
               Clone the current branch as <new-branch>, if specified, or
               using the current branch name with a timestamp.
               The description of the new branch will indicate it is a clone
               of the current branch. The parent information of the new
               branch is copied from the current branch.
           --rename
               Rename an existing branch
           --protect
               Prevent StGit from modifying a branch
           --unprotect
               Allow StGit to modify a previously protected branch
           --delete
               Delete a branch.
               The branch will not be deleted if there are any patches
               remaining unless the --force option is provided.
               A protected branch may not be deleted; it must be unprotected
               first.
           --cleanup
               Remove StGit patch stack from branch. The operation will be
               refused if any patches remain, unless the --force option is
               provided.
               A protected branch will not be cleaned up; it must be
               unprotected first.
               A cleaned up branch may be reinitialized using stg-init(1).
           --describe
               Set the branch description
## OPTIONS         top
           --merge
               Merge work tree changes into the other branch
       --DELETE OPTIONS
           --force
               Force deletion even if branch has patches
       --CLEANUP OPTIONS
           --force
               Force clean up even if branch has patches
