## NAME         top
           pmdaib - Infiniband performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSYS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/infiniband/pmdaib [-c configFile] [-D debug] [-d
           domain] [-l logfile] [-w]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdaib is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
           information and performance metrics about local Infiniband HCAs
           and local or remote Infiniband GUIDs.
           A brief description of the pmdaib command line options follows:
           -c   Location of the config file.  By default, the config file is
                named $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/infiniband/config.  See CONFIG FILE for
                more information.
           -D   A debug values, as specified by pmdbg(1)
           -d   Specify an alternate performance metrics domain number.
                Almost never necessary.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                ib.log is written to $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file
                cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to
                the standard error instead.
           -w   Write out the default config file to
                $PCP_PMDAS_DIRS/infiniband and exit immediately.  The
                written config file will contain the local HCA ports.  It
                will not overwrite an existing file.  This argument should
                only be used to create the template config file and should
                never appear in pmcd.conf.  See CONFIG FILE for more
                information on the file format and on monitoring remote
                GUIDs.
## CONFIG FILE         top
           By default, the PMDA will operate without using a config file.
           In this mode of operation the local HCA ports will be monitored.
           Note that if a new HCA is added to the machine that instance
           domain naming may change because it will always be based on the
           kernel's naming.
           In cases where this is not acceptable, or in the case where
           monitoring remote Infiniband ports is required, a config file
           must be created.  A "template" file can be created by running the
           pmdaib daemon with the -w argument.  This will create a config
           file with the local ports and GUIDs.
           If the config file is executable then it will be run and the
           output will be used as the config file.
           The config file is composed of line-based records.  Blank lines
           and everything after the hash (#) character are ignored.  Each
           line has 6 fields:
           [instName] [portGUID] [portNum] via
           [localPortName]:[localPortNum]
           The first field is used to give a static instance name to the
           Infiniband port that has a specific GUID.  All of the other
           fields must be properly specified in order to monitor a
           particular port.
           For example, to monitor port 1 of the local HCA called 'mthca0' a
           possible config file line would be:
           myPort1 0xdeadbeef01234567 1 via mthca0:1
           Remote ports can be easily monitored by specifying the GUID of
           the HCA or switch and specifying the remote port number.  The
           localPortName:localPortNum tuple specifies which local HCA and
           port to use as the "first hop" in contacting the remote GUID.
           E.g., to monitor port 13 of a remote switch which is connected to
           the fabric on the first port of the second HCA:
           switch13 0xfeeffeefabcdabcd 13 via mthca1:1
## LOCAL CONTEXT         top
           The Infiniband pmda also supports accessing the metrics via
           PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL when using the PMAPI interface.  In order to use
           the Infiniband pmda in this way, set the environment variable
           PMDA_LOCAL_IB prior to calling pmNewContext(3).
