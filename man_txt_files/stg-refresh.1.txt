## NAME         top
           stg-refresh - Incorporate worktree changes into current patch
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg refresh [OPTIONS] [path]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Include the latest work tree and index changes in the current
           patch. This command generates a new git commit object for the
           patch; the old commit is no longer visible.
           Refresh will warn if the index is dirty, and require use of
           either the --index or --force options to override this check.
           This is to prevent accidental full refresh when only some changes
           were staged using git add interactive mode.
           You may optionally list one or more files or directories relative
           to the current working directory; if you do, only matching files
           will be updated.
           Behind the scenes, stg refresh first creates a new temporary
           patch with your updates, and then merges that patch into the
           patch you asked to have refreshed. If you asked to refresh a
           patch other than the topmost patch, there can be conflicts; in
           that case, the temporary patch will be left for you to take care
           of, for example with stg squash.
           The creation of the temporary patch is recorded in a separate
           entry in the patch stack log; this means that one undo step will
           undo the merge between the other patch and the temp patch, and
           two undo steps will additionally get rid of the temp patch.
## OPTIONS         top
           -u, --update
               Only update the current patch files
           -i, --index
               Instead of setting the patch top to the current contents of
               the worktree, set it to the current contents of the index.
           -F, --force
               Instead of warning the user when some work has already been
               staged (such as with git add interactive mode) force a full
               refresh.
           --conflicts[=<policy>]
               Either "allow" or "disallow" pushing a patch with conflicts.
               Using --conflicts=allow (or just --conflicts) allows pushing
               a patch that may result in unresolved merge conflicts. The
               patch will be pushed and files with conflicts will be left
               with conflict markers to be resolved manually; or the
               operation undone with stg undo --hard. This is the default
               behavior and also corresponds to the
               "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" variable being set to "true".
               Using --conflicts=disallow disallows pushing any patch that
               would result in merge conflicts. The operation will stop on
               the last patch that can be pushed without conflicts. This
               behavior can be configured by setting
               "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" to "false".
           -p <patch>, --patch=<patch>
               Refresh (applied) <patch> instead of the top patch
           -a <note>, --annotate=<note>
               Annotate the patch log entry with <note>
           --submodules
               Include submodules in patch content
           --no-submodules
               Exclude submodules in patch content
           -e, --edit
               Invoke editor for patch description
           -d, --diff
               Show diff when editing patch description
           -m <message>, --message=<message>
               Use message instead of invoking the editor
           -f <path>, --file=<path>
               Use the contents of file instead of invoking the editor. Use
               "-" to read from stdin.
           --no-verify
               Disable commit-msg hook
           -s[=<value>], --signoff[=<value>]
               Add "Signed-off-by" message trailer.
               The value is optional and defaults to the committer name and
               email. This option may be provided multiple times.
           --ack[=<value>]
               Add "Acked-by" message trailer.
               The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
               and email. This option may be provided multiple times.
           --review[=<value>]
               Add "Reviewed-by" message trailer.
               The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
               and email. This option may be provided multiple times.
           --author=<name-and-email>
               Set the author "name <email>"
           --authname=<name>
               Set the author name
           --authemail=<email>
               Set the author email
           --authdate=<date>
               Set the date the patch was authored.
               Use "now" to use the current time and date.
           --committer-date-is-author-date
               Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
               the author date of the commit as the committer date.
