## NAME         top
           dh_installmodules - register kernel modules
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installmodules [debhelper options] [-n] [--name=name]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installmodules is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           registering kernel modules.
           Kernel modules are searched for in the package build directory
           and if found, preinst, postinst and postrm commands are
           automatically generated to run depmod and register the modules
           when the package is installed.  These commands are inserted into
           the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb(1).
## FILES         top
           debian/package.modprobe
               Installed to etc/modprobe.d/package.conf in the package build
               directory.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --no-scripts
               Do not modify preinst/postinst/postrm scripts.
           --name=name
               When this parameter is used, dh_installmodules looks for and
               installs files named debian/package.name.modprobe instead of
               the usual debian/package.modprobe
## NOTES         top
           Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
           called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may
           cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
           maintainer scripts.
