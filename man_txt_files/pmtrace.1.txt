## NAME         top
           pmtrace - command line performance instrumentation
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmtrace [-q?]  [-c value | -e command | -v value] [-h host] [-S
           state] tag
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmtrace provides a simple command line interface to the trace
           Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) and the associated
           pcp_trace library.
           The default pmtrace behavior is to provide point trace data to
           the trace PMDA, using the tag argument as the identifying name
           associated with each trace point.  The tag then becomes an
           instance identifier within the set of trace.point metrics.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -c value
                Allow an arbitrary counter value to be exported through the
                trace.count metrics.
           -e command
                Allow an arbitrary command to be executed.  This command
                will be measured as a transaction since it has well defined
                start and end points.  The information is made available
                through the trace.transact metrics.
           -h host
                Sent the trace data to the trace PMDA running on host,
                rather than the localhost.  This overrides use of the
                environment variable PCP_TRACE_HOST.
           -q   Suppress messages from a successful trace, so that pmtrace
                runs quietly.
           -S state
                Enable internal debugging and tracing.  The value of state
                is a bit-wise combination of debug flags as defined in
                pmtracestate(3), and may be specified using the decimal or
                hexadecimal syntax prescribed by strtol(3).
           -v value
                Allow an arbitrary floating point value to be exported
                through the trace.observe metrics.
           -?   Display usage message and exit.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           All are generated on standard error and are intended to be self-
           explanatory.
           The pmtrace exit status is always zero except when the -e option
           is in use, in which case the exit status of command is returned.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_DEMOS_DIR/trace/pmtrace.c
                source code for pmtrace
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           Since pmtrace uses the libpcp_trace library routines, the
           environment variables PCP_TRACE_HOST, PCP_TRACE_PORT, and
           PCP_TRACE_TIMEOUT are all honored.  Refer to pmdatrace(3) for a
           detailed description of the semantics of each.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
