    SLABTOP(1)                    User Commands                   SLABTOP(1)
## NAME         top
           slabtop - display kernel slab cache information in real time
## SYNOPSIS         top
           slabtop [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           slabtop displays detailed kernel slab cache information in real
           time.  It displays a listing of the top caches sorted by one of
           the listed sort criteria.  It also displays a statistics header
           filled with slab layer information.
## OPTIONS         top
           Normal invocation of slabtop does not require any options.  The
           behavior, however, can be fine-tuned by specifying one or more of
           the following flags:
           -d, --delay=N
                  Refresh the display every n in seconds.  By default,
                  slabtop refreshes the display every three seconds.  To
                  exit the program, hit q.  This cannot be combined with the
                  -o option.
           -s, --sort=S
                  Sort by S, where S is one of the sort criteria.
           -o, --once
                  Display the output once and then exit.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information and exit.
           -h, --help
                  Display usage information and exit.
## SORT CRITERIA         top
           The following are valid sort criteria used to sort the individual
           slab caches and thereby determine what are the "top" slab caches
           to display.  The default sort criteria is to sort by the number
           of objects ("o").
           The sort criteria can also be changed while slabtop is running by
           pressing the associated character.
           character   description                header
           a           number of active objects   ACTIVE
           b           objects per slab           OBJ/SLAB

           l           number of slabs            SLABS
           v           number of active slabs     N/A

           o           number of objects          OBJS
           p           pages per slab             N/A

           u           cache utilization          USE
## COMMANDS         top
           slabtop accepts keyboard commands from the user during use.  The
           following are supported.  In the case of letters, both cases are
           accepted.
           Each of the valid sort characters are also accepted, to change
           the sort routine. See the section SORT CRITERIA.
           <SPACEBAR>
                  Refresh the screen.
           Q      Quit the program.
## FILES         top
           /proc/slabinfo
                  slab information
## SEE ALSO         top
           free(1), ps(1), top(1), vmstat(8)
## NOTES         top
           Currently, slabtop requires a 2.4 or later kernel (specifically,
           a version 1.1 or later /proc/slabinfo).  Kernel 2.2 should be
           supported in the future.
           The slabtop statistic header is tracking how many bytes of slabs
           are being used and is not a measure of physical memory.  The
           'Slab' field in the /proc/meminfo file is tracking information
           about used slab physical memory.
           The CACHE SIZE column is not accurate, it's the upper limit of
           memory used by specific slab. When system using slub (most common
           case) is under high memory pressure, there are slab order
           fallbacks, which means "pages per slab" is not constant and may
           decrease.
