## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           cat — concatenate and print files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cat [-u] [file...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The cat utility shall read files in sequence and shall write
           their contents to the standard output in the same sequence.
## OPTIONS         top
           The cat utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following option shall be supported:
           -u        Write bytes from the input file to the standard output
                     without delay as each is read.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of an input file. If no file operands are
                     specified, the standard input shall be used. If a file
                     is '-', the cat utility shall read from the standard
                     input at that point in the sequence. The cat utility
                     shall not close and reopen standard input when it is
                     referenced in this way, but shall accept multiple
                     occurrences of '-' as a file operand.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be used only if no file operands are
           specified, or if a file operand is '-'.  See the INPUT FILES
           section.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The input files can be any file type.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           cat:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The standard output shall contain the sequence of bytes read from
           the input files. Nothing else shall be written to the standard
           output.  If the standard output is a regular file, and is the
           same file as any of the input file operands, the implementation
           may treat this as an error.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    All input files were output successfully.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           The -u option has value in prototyping non-blocking reads from
           FIFOs. The intent is to support the following sequence:
               mkfifo foo
               cat -u foo > /dev/tty13 &
               cat -u > foo
           It is unspecified whether standard output is or is not buffered
           in the default case. This is sometimes of interest when standard
           output is associated with a terminal, since buffering may delay
           the output. The presence of the -u option guarantees that
           unbuffered I/O is available. It is implementation-defined whether
           the cat utility buffers output if the -u option is not specified.
           Traditionally, the -u option is implemented using the equivalent
           of the setvbuf() function defined in the System Interfaces volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017.
## EXAMPLES         top
           The following command:
               cat myfile
           writes the contents of the file myfile to standard output.
           The following command:
               cat doc1 doc2 > doc.all
           concatenates the files doc1 and doc2 and writes the result to
           doc.all.
           Because of the shell language mechanism used to perform output
           redirection, a command such as this:
               cat doc doc.end > doc
           causes the original data in doc to be lost before cat even begins
           execution. This is true whether the cat command fails with an
           error or silently succeeds (the specification allows both
           behaviors). In order to append the contents of doc.end without
           losing the original contents of doc, this command should be used
           instead:
               cat doc.end >> doc
           The command:
               cat start - middle - end > file
           when standard input is a terminal, gets two arbitrary pieces of
           input from the terminal with a single invocation of cat.  Note,
           however, that if standard input is a regular file, this would be
           equivalent to the command:
               cat start - middle /dev/null end > file
           because the entire contents of the file would be consumed by cat
           the first time '-' was used as a file operand and an end-of-file
           condition would be detected immediately when '-' was referenced
           the second time.
## RATIONALE         top
           Historical versions of the cat utility include the -e, -t, and
           -v, options which permit the ends of lines, <tab> characters, and
           invisible characters, respectively, to be rendered visible in the
           output. The standard developers omitted these options because
           they provide too fine a degree of control over what is made
           visible, and similar output can be obtained using a command such
           as:
               sed -n l pathname
           The latter also has the advantage that its output is unambiguous,
           whereas the output of historical cat -etv is not.
           The -s option was omitted because it corresponds to different
           functions in BSD and System V-based systems. The BSD -s option to
           squeeze blank lines can be accomplished by the shell script shown
           in the following example:
               sed -n '
               # Write non-empty lines.
               /./   {
                     p
                     d
                     }
               # Write a single empty line, then look for more empty lines.
               /^$/  p
               # Get next line, discard the held <newline> (empty line),
               # and look for more empty lines.
               :Empty
               /^$/  {
                     N
                     s/.//
                     b Empty
                     }
               # Write the non-empty line before going back to search
               # for the first in a set of empty lines.
                     p
               '
           The System V -s option to silence error messages can be
           accomplished by redirecting the standard error. Note that the BSD
           documentation for cat uses the term ``blank line'' to mean the
           same as the POSIX ``empty line'': a line consisting only of a
           <newline>.
           The BSD -n option was omitted because similar functionality can
           be obtained from the -n option of the pr utility.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
