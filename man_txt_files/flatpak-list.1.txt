    FLATPAK LIST(1)               flatpak list               FLATPAK LIST(1)
## NAME         top
           flatpak-list - List installed applications and/or runtimes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak list [OPTION...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Lists the names of the installed applications and runtimes.
           By default, both apps and runtimes are shown, but you can change
           this by using the --app or --runtime options.
           By default, both per-user and system-wide installations are
           shown. Use the --user, --installation or --system options to
           change this.
           The list command can also be used to find installed apps that use
           a certain runtime, with the --app-runtime option.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -u, --user
               List per-user installations.
           --system
               List the default system-wide installations.
           --installation=NAME
               List a system-wide installation specified by NAME among those
               defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --arch=ARCH
               List apps/runtimes for this architecture. See flatpak
               --supported-arches for architectures supported by the host.
           -d, --show-details
               Show origin, sizes and other extra information. Equivalent to
               --columns=all.
           --app
               List applications.
           --runtime
               List runtimes.
           --all, -a
               List all installed runtimes, including locale and debug
               extensions. These are hidden by default.
           --app-runtime=RUNTIME
               List applications that use the given runtime.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
           --columns=FIELD,...
               Specify what information to show about each ref. You can list
               multiple fields, or use this option multiple times.
               Append :s[tart], :m[iddle], :e[nd] or :f[ull] to column names
               to change ellipsization.
## FIELDS         top
