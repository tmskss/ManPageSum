## NAME         top
           pcp-numastat - report on NUMA memory allocation
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] numastat [-Vw?]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-numastat displays NUMA allocation statistics from the kernel
           memory allocator.  Each process has NUMA policies that specify on
           which node pages are allocated.  The performance counters in the
           kernel track on which nodes memory is allocated and these values
           are sampled and reported by pcp-numastat.
           Counters are maintained individually for each NUMA node.  Details
           of the semantics of each reported metric can be retrieved using
           the following command:
                # pminfo ‐dt mem.numa.alloc
## OPTIONS         top
           When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
           -O/--origin, -Z/--timezone and several other pcp options become
           indirectly available; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete
           description of these options.
           The additional command line options available for pcp-numastat
           are:
           -V, --version
                Display the current version of the command.
           -w width, --width=width
                Limit display to width.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## NOTES         top
           pcp-numastat is inspired by the numastat(1) command and produces
           exactly the same output.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
