## NAME         top
           pmdabpftrace - bpftrace PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdabpftrace is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics
           Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports metrics from bpftrace(8)
           scripts.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           pmdabpftrace reads an optional ini-style configuration file:
                  $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpftrace/bpftrace.conf
           This file may contain [bpftrace] and [dynamic_scripts] sections.
           If you enable the dynamic scripts functionality, please refer to
           https://pcp.io/docs/lab.auth.html on how to setup authentication.
           This is highly recommended, as otherwise anyone could run any
           bpftrace(8) script as root.
           [bpftrace] section specifies values for the following settings
           (their default values are shown in parenthesis):
           bpftrace_path (bpftrace)
                  Path to the bpftrace(8) executable.
           script_expiry_time (60)
                  Unnamed scripts are removed after this period of time (in
                  seconds) in case there has been no requests for their
                  values.
           max_throughput (2097152)
                  Maximum throughput of bpftrace scripts in bytes.
           [dynamic_scripts] section specifies values for the following
           settings (their default values are shown in parenthesis):
           enabled (false)
                  A boolean value to specify whether script should be
                  started on demand, by executing pmStore (3)
                  bpftrace.control.register.  This feature needs to be
                  enabled for the PCP bpftrace datasource in grafana-pcp.
           auth_enabled (true)
                  A boolean value to specify whether authentication is
                  required or not.  Please see the note above on
                  authentication setup.
           allowed_users (root)
                  A comma-separated list of usernames which are allowed to
                  register bpftrace(8) scripts.
## INSTALLATION         top
           To install, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpftrace
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpftrace
               # ./Remove
           pmdabpftrace is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpftrace/bpftrace.conf
                configuration file for the pmdabpftrace agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpftrace/Install
                installation script for the pmdabpftrace agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bpftrace/Remove
                undo installation script for the pmdabpftrace agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/bpftrace.log
                default log file for messages from the pmdabpftrace agent
           Note that the usual/default value for $PCP_PMDAS_DIR is
           /var/lib/pcp/pmdas and the default for $PCP_LOG_DIR is
           /var/log/pcp but these settings are platform dependent.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
