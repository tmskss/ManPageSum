## NAME         top
           pmdarsyslog - rsyslog (reliable and extended syslog) PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdarsyslog is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values from the rsyslogd(8) server.
           Further details about rsyslog can be found at
           http://www.rsyslog.com/ .
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names and values for the rsyslog
           performance metrics, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog
               # ./Remove
           pmdarsyslog is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
           In order to use this agent, rsyslog stats gathering must be
           enabled.  This is done by adding the lines:
               module(load="impstats" interval="10" severity="7")
               if $syslogtag contains 'rsyslogd-pstats' then {
                   action(
                       name="pstats-for-pcp"
                       type="ompipe"
                       template="RSYSLOG_FileFormat"
                       pipe="/var/log/pcp/rsyslog/stats"
                   )
                   stop
               }
           to your rsyslog.conf(5) configuration file after installing the
           PMDA.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/rsyslog/stats
               named pipe containing statistics exported from rsyslog,
               usually created by the PMDA Install script.
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog/rsyslog.conf
               optional configuration file for pmdarsyslog
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog/Install
               installation script for the pmdarsyslog agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/rsyslog/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdarsyslog agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/rsyslog.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdarsyslog
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
