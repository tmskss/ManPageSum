## NAME         top
           lttng-add-context - Add context fields to an LTTng channel
## SYNOPSIS         top
           Add context fields to a channel:
           lttng [GENERAL OPTIONS] add-context
                 (--kernel | --userspace | --jul | --log4j)
                 [--session=SESSION] [--channel=CHANNEL]
                 --type=TYPE [--type=TYPE]...
           List the available context fields:
           lttng [GENERAL OPTIONS] add-context --list
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The lttng add-context command adds one or more context fields to
           a channel.
           Channels are created with the lttng-enable-channel(1) command.
           When context fields are added to a channel, all the events
           emitted within this channel contain the dynamic values of those
           context fields.
           If the --session option is omitted, the current tracing session
           is used. If the --channel option is omitted, the context fields
           are added to all the selected tracing session’s channels.
           Many context fields can be added to a channel at once by
           repeating the --type option.
           perf counters are available as per-CPU (perf:cpu: prefix) as well
           as per-thread (perf:thread: prefix) counters. Currently, per-CPU
           counters can only be used in the Linux kernel tracing domain,
           while per-thread counters can only be used in the user space
           tracing domain.
           It is also possible to enable PMU counters by raw ID using the
           perf:cpu:raw:rN:NAME (Linux kernel tracing domain) or
           perf:thread:raw:rN:NAME (user space tracing domain), with:
           N
               A hexadecimal event descriptor which is the same format as
               used by perf-record(1): a concatenation of the event number
               and umask value provided by the processor’s manufacturer. The
               possible values for this field are processor-specific.
           NAME
               Custom name to easily recognize the counter.
           Application-specific context fields can be added to a channel
           using the following syntax:
               $app.PROVIDER:TYPE
           with:
           PROVIDER
               Provider name.
           TYPE
               Context type name.
               Note
               Make sure to single-quote the type when running the command
               from a shell, as $ is a special character for variable
               substitution in most shells.
           Use the --list option without other arguments to list the
           available context field names.
           See the LIMITATIONS section below for a list of limitations to
           consider.
## OPTIONS         top
           General options are described in lttng(1).
       Domain
           One of:
           -j, --jul
               Add context to channel in the java.util.logging (JUL) domain.
           -k, --kernel
               Add context to channel in the Linux kernel domain.
           -l, --log4j
               Add context to channel in the Apache log4j domain.
           -u, --userspace
               Add context to channel in the user space domain.
       Target
           -c CHANNEL, --channel=CHANNEL
               Add context fields to a channel named CHANNEL instead of
               adding them to all the channels.
           -s SESSION, --session=SESSION
               Add context fields to a channel in the tracing session named
               SESSION instead of the current tracing session.
       Context
           --list
               List the available context fields. Use this option alone.
           -t TYPE, --type=TYPE
               Add context field named TYPE. This option can be repeated as
               many times as needed on the command-line.
       Program information
           -h, --help
               Show command help.
               This option, like lttng-help(1), attempts to launch
               /usr/bin/man to view the command’s man page. The path to the
               man pager can be overridden by the LTTNG_MAN_BIN_PATH
               environment variable.
           --list-options
               List available command options.
## LIMITATIONS         top
           As of this version of LTTng, it is not possible to add context
           fields to a channel once its tracing session has been started
           (see lttng-start(1)) at least once.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           LTTNG_ABORT_ON_ERROR
               Set to 1 to abort the process after the first error is
               encountered.
           LTTNG_HOME
               Overrides the $HOME environment variable. Useful when the
               user running the commands has a non-writable home directory.
           LTTNG_MAN_BIN_PATH
               Absolute path to the man pager to use for viewing help
               information about LTTng commands (using lttng-help(1) or
               lttng COMMAND --help).
           LTTNG_SESSION_CONFIG_XSD_PATH
               Path in which the session.xsd session configuration XML
               schema may be found.
           LTTNG_SESSIOND_PATH
               Full session daemon binary path.
               The --sessiond-path option has precedence over this
               environment variable.
           Note that the lttng-create(1) command can spawn an LTTng session
           daemon automatically if none is running. See lttng-sessiond(8)
           for the environment variables influencing the execution of the
           session daemon.
## FILES         top
           $LTTNG_HOME/.lttngrc
               User LTTng runtime configuration.
               This is where the per-user current tracing session is stored
               between executions of lttng(1). The current tracing session
               can be set with lttng-set-session(1). See lttng-create(1) for
               more information about tracing sessions.
           $LTTNG_HOME/lttng-traces
               Default output directory of LTTng traces. This can be
               overridden with the --output option of the lttng-create(1)
               command.
           $LTTNG_HOME/.lttng
               User LTTng runtime and configuration directory.
           $LTTNG_HOME/.lttng/sessions
               Default location of saved user tracing sessions (see
               lttng-save(1) and lttng-load(1)).
           /usr/local/etc/lttng/sessions
               System-wide location of saved tracing sessions (see
               lttng-save(1) and lttng-load(1)).
               Note
               $LTTNG_HOME defaults to $HOME when not explicitly set.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0
               Success
           1
               Command error
           2
               Undefined command
           3
               Fatal error
           4
               Command warning (something went wrong during the command)
