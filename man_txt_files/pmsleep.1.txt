## NAME         top
           pmpause, pmsleep - portable subsecond-capable sleep
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmpause
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsleep interval
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmpause sleeps indefinitely, until interrupted by SIGKILL.
           pmsleep sleeps for the specified interval.  The interval argument
           follows the syntax described in PCPIntro(1) for -t, and in the
           simplest form may be an unsigned integer or floating point
           constant (the implied units in this case are seconds).
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           The exit status is 0 for success, or 1 for a malformed command
           line.  If the underlying nanosleep(2) system call fails, an errno
           is returned.
## SEE ALSO         top
           sleep(1), pause(2) and nanosleep(2).
