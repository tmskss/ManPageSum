## NAME         top
           @CLEAR@ - clear the terminal screen
## SYNOPSIS         top
           @CLEAR@ [-Ttype] [-V] [-x]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           @CLEAR@ clears your terminal's screen if this is possible,
           including the terminal's scrollback buffer (if the extended “E3”
           capability is defined).  @CLEAR@ looks in the environment for the
           terminal type given by the environment variable TERM, and then in
           the terminfo database to determine how to clear the screen.
           @CLEAR@ writes to the standard output.  You can redirect the
           standard output to a file (which prevents @CLEAR@ from actually
           clearing the screen), and later cat the file to the screen,
           clearing it at that point.
## OPTIONS         top
           -T type
                indicates the type of terminal.  Normally this option is
                unnecessary, because the default is taken from the
                environment variable TERM.  If -T is specified, then the
                shell variables LINES and COLUMNS will also be ignored.
           -V   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this
                program, and exits.  The options are as follows:
           -x   do not attempt to clear the terminal's scrollback buffer
                using the extended “E3” capability.
## HISTORY         top
           A clear command appeared in 2.79BSD dated February 24, 1979.
           Later that was provided in Unix 8th edition (1985).
           AT&T adapted a different BSD program (tset) to make a new command
           (tput), and used this to replace the clear command with a shell
           script which calls tput clear, e.g.,
               /usr/bin/tput ${1:+-T$1} clear 2> /dev/null
               exit
           In 1989, when Keith Bostic revised the BSD tput command to make
           it similar to the AT&T tput, he added a shell script for the
           clear command:
               exec tput clear
           The remainder of the script in each case is a copyright notice.
           The ncurses clear command began in 1995 by adapting the original
           BSD clear command (with terminfo, of course).
           The E3 extension came later:
           •   In June 1999, xterm provided an extension to the standard
               control sequence for clearing the screen.  Rather than
               clearing just the visible part of the screen using
                   printf '\033[2J'
               one could clear the scrollback using
                   printf '\033[3J'
               This is documented in XTerm Control Sequences as a feature
               originating with xterm.
           •   A few other terminal developers adopted the feature, e.g.,
               PuTTY in 2006.
           •   In April 2011, a Red Hat developer submitted a patch to the
               Linux kernel, modifying its console driver to do the same
               thing.  The Linux change, part of the 3.0 release, did not
               mention xterm, although it was cited in the Red Hat bug
               report (#683733) which led to the change.
           •   Again, a few other terminal developers adopted the feature.
               But the next relevant step was a change to the clear program
               in 2013 to incorporate this extension.
           •   In 2013, the E3 extension was overlooked in @TPUT@ with the
               “clear” parameter.  That was addressed in 2016 by
               reorganizing @TPUT@ to share its logic with @CLEAR@ and
               @TSET@.
## PORTABILITY         top
           Neither IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open  Group  Base  Specifications
           Issue  7 (POSIX.1-2008) nor X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents
           @TSET@ or @RESET@.
           The latter documents tput, which could be used to replace this
           utility either via a shell script or by an alias (such as a
           symbolic link) to run @TPUT@ as @CLEAR@.
## SEE ALSO         top
           @TPUT@(1), terminfo(5), xterm(1).
           This describes ncurses version @NCURSES_MAJOR@.@NCURSES_MINOR@
           (patch @NCURSES_PATCH@).
