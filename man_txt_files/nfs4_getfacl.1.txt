## NAME         top
           nfs4_getfacl - get NFSv4 file/directory access control lists
## SYNOPSIS         top
           nfs4_getfacl [-HR] file ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           nfs4_getfacl will display the NFSv4 Access Control List (ACL) for
           the files given as arguments, provided they are on mounted NFSv4
           filesystems which support ACLs.
           If the -H/--more-help flag is specified, nfs4_getfacl will print
           some information about NFSv4 ACLs and the fields used in ACEs.
           If the -R/--recursive flag is specified, nfs4_getfacl will list
           the NFSv4 ACLs of all files and directories recursively.
           If the -c/--omit-header flag is specified, nfs4_getfacl will not
           display the comment header (Do not print filename).
           If the --dacl flag is specified, nfs4_getfacl will retrieve the
           dacl. This functionality is only available if the server supports
           NFSv4 minor version 1 or newer.
           If the --sacl flag is specified, nfs4_getfacl will retrieve the
           sacl. This functionality is only available if the server supports
           NFSv4 minor version 1 or newer.
           The output format for an NFSv4 file ACL, e.g., is:
                  # file: /somedir
                  A::OWNER@:rwatTnNcCy
                  A::alice@nfsdomain.org:rxtncy
                  A::bob@nfsdomain.org:rwadtTnNcCy
                  A:g:GROUP@:rtncy
                  D:g:GROUP@:waxTC
                  A::EVERYONE@:rtncy
                  D::EVERYONE@:waxTC
           In the example output above, the user `alice@nfsdomain.org' has
           the equivalent of "read" and "execute" permissions,
           `bob@nfsdomain.org' has "read" and "write", and both `GROUP@' and
           `EVERYONE@' have "read".
           The ACL listings of multiple files are separated by blank lines.
           Refer to the nfs4_acl(5) manpage for detailed information about
           NFSv4 ACL terminology and syntax.
