## NAME         top
           pmdazimbra - Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdazimbra is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values from several subsystems of the Zimbra
           Suite.
           Further details on Zimbra can be found at http://www.zimbra.com/ .
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install the zimbra PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zimbra
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zimbra
               # ./Remove
           pmdazimbra is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           /opt/zimbra/zmstat/*
               comma-separated value files containing Zimbra performance
               data
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zimbra/Install
               installation script for the pmdazimbra agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zimbra/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdazimbra agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/zimbra.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdazimbra
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
