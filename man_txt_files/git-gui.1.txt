    GIT-GUI(1)                     Git Manual                     GIT-GUI(1)
## NAME         top
           git-gui - A portable graphical interface to Git
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git gui [<command>] [<arguments>]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           A Tcl/Tk based graphical user interface to Git. git gui focuses
           on allowing users to make changes to their repository by making
           new commits, amending existing ones, creating branches,
           performing local merges, and fetching/pushing to remote
           repositories.
           Unlike gitk, git gui focuses on commit generation and single file
           annotation and does not show project history. It does however
           supply menu actions to start a gitk session from within git gui.
           git gui is known to work on all popular UNIX systems, Mac OS X,
           and Windows (under both Cygwin and MSYS). To the extent possible
           OS specific user interface guidelines are followed, making git
           gui a fairly native interface for users.
## COMMANDS         top
           blame
               Start a blame viewer on the specified file on the given
               version (or working directory if not specified).
           browser
               Start a tree browser showing all files in the specified
               commit. Files selected through the browser are opened in the
               blame viewer.
           citool
               Start git gui and arrange to make exactly one commit before
               exiting and returning to the shell. The interface is limited
               to only commit actions, slightly reducing the application’s
               startup time and simplifying the menubar.
           version
               Display the currently running version of git gui.
## EXAMPLES         top
           git gui blame Makefile
               Show the contents of the file Makefile in the current working
               directory, and provide annotations for both the original
               author of each line, and who moved the line to its current
               location. The uncommitted file is annotated, and uncommitted
               changes (if any) are explicitly attributed to Not Yet
               Committed.
           git gui blame v0.99.8 Makefile
               Show the contents of Makefile in revision v0.99.8 and provide
               annotations for each line. Unlike the above example the file
               is read from the object database and not the working
               directory.
           git gui blame --line=100 Makefile
               Loads annotations as described above and automatically
               scrolls the view to center on line 100.
           git gui citool
               Make one commit and return to the shell when it is complete.
               This command returns a non-zero exit code if the window was
               closed in any way other than by making a commit.
           git gui citool --amend
               Automatically enter the Amend Last Commit mode of the
               interface.
           git gui citool --nocommit
               Behave as normal citool, but instead of making a commit
               simply terminate with a zero exit code. It still checks that
               the index does not contain any unmerged entries, so you can
               use it as a GUI version of git-mergetool(1)
           git citool
               Same as git gui citool (above).
           git gui browser maint
               Show a browser for the tree of the maint branch. Files
               selected in the browser can be viewed with the internal blame
               viewer.
## SEE ALSO         top
           gitk(1)
               The Git repository browser. Shows branches, commit history
               and file differences. gitk is the utility started by git
               gui's Repository Visualize actions.
## OTHER         top
           git gui is actually maintained as an independent project, but
           stable versions are distributed as part of the Git suite for the
           convenience of end users.
           The official repository of the git gui project can be found at:
               https://github.com/prati0100/git-gui.git/
