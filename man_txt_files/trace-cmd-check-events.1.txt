## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-check-events - parse the event formats on local system
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd check-events [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) check-events parses format strings for all the
           events on the local system. It returns whether all the format
           strings can be parsed correctly. It will load plugins unless
           specified otherwise.
           This is useful to check for any trace event format strings which
           may contain some internal kernel function references which cannot
           be decoded outside of the kernel. This may mean that either the
           unparsed format strings of the trace events need to be changed or
           that a plugin needs to be created to parse them.
## OPTIONS         top
           -N - Don’t load plugins
           --verbose[=level]
               Set the log level. Supported log levels are "none",
               "critical", "error", "warning", "info", "debug", "all" or
               their identifiers "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6". Setting
               the log level to specific value enables all logs from that
               and all previous levels. The level will default to "info" if
               one is not specified.
                   Example: enable all critical, error and warning logs
                   trace-cmd check-events --verbose=warning
