## NAME         top
           printf - format and print data
## SYNOPSIS         top
           printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...
           printf OPTION
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Print ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT, or execute according to
           OPTION:
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           FORMAT controls the output as in C printf.  Interpreted sequences
           are:
           \"     double quote
           \\     backslash
           \a     alert (BEL)
           \b     backspace
           \c     produce no further output
           \e     escape
           \f     form feed
           \n     new line
           \r     carriage return
           \t     horizontal tab
           \v     vertical tab
           \NNN   byte with octal value NNN (1 to 3 digits)
           \xHH   byte with hexadecimal value HH (1 to 2 digits)
           \uHHHH Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character with hex value HHHH (4
                  digits)
           \UHHHHHHHH
                  Unicode character with hex value HHHHHHHH (8 digits)
           %%     a single %
           %b     ARGUMENT as a string with '\' escapes interpreted, except
                  that octal escapes are of the form \0 or \0NNN
           %q     ARGUMENT is printed in a format that can be reused as
                  shell input, escaping non-printable characters with the
                  proposed POSIX $'' syntax.
           and all C format specifications ending with one of diouxXfeEgGcs,
           with ARGUMENTs converted to proper type first.  Variable widths
           are handled.
           NOTE: your shell may have its own version of printf, which
           usually supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to
           your shell's documentation for details about the options it
           supports.
