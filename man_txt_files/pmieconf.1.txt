## NAME         top
           pmieconf - display and set configurable pmie rule variables
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmieconf [-cFv?]  [-f file] [-r rulepath] [command [args...]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmieconf is a utility for viewing and configuring variables from
           generalized pmie(1) rules.  The set of generalized rules is read
           in from rulepath, and the output file produced by pmieconf is a
           valid input file for pmie.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -c   When run from automated pmie setup processes, this option is
                used to add a specific message and timestamp indicating that
                this is the case.  Unless over-ridden by the -f flag, the
                default configuration file to be written or updated when the
                -c flag is given and pmieconf is run by the root user, is
                $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmie/config.default.  This is also the
                default configuration file used by the pmie service, see
                pmie_daily(1).  This flag is not appropriate when using the
                tool interactively.
           -f file, --config=file
                Any rule modifications resulting from pmieconf manipulation
                of variable values will be written to file.  The default
                value of file is dependent on the user ID - for the root
                user (when the -c flag is not also given, see above) the
                file is $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmie/config.default.  For other
                users the default is $HOME/.pcp/pmie/config.pmie.
           -F, --force
                Forces the pmieconf output file to be created (or updated),
                after which pmieconf immediately exits.
           -r rulepath, --rules=rulepath
                Allows the source of generalized pmie rules to be changed -
                rulepath is a colon-delimited list of pmieconf(5) rule files
                and/or subdirectories.  The default value for rulepath is
                $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmieconf.  Use of this option overrides
                the PMIECONF_PATH environment variable which has a similar
                function.
           -v, --verbose
                Enable verbose mode.  associated variables will be
                displayed.  This is the complete list of variables which
                affects any given rule (by default, global variables are not
                displayed with the rule).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
           The pmieconf commands allow information related to the various
           rules and configurable variables to be displayed or modified.  If
           no pmieconf commands are presented on the command line, pmieconf
           prompts for commands interactively.
## COMMAND LANGUAGE         top
           The pmieconf command language is described here:
           help  [ { . | all | global | <rule> | <group> } [<variable>] ]
                   Without arguments, the help command displays the syntax
                   for all of the available pmieconf commands.  With one
                   argument, a description of one or more of the generalized
                   rules is displayed.  With two arguments, a description of
                   a specific variable relating to one or more of the
                   generalized rules is displayed.
           rules  [ enabled | disabled ]
                   Display the name and short summary for all of the
                   generalized rules found on rulepath.  Each of the rule
                   names can be used in place of the keyword <rule> in this
                   command syntax description.  The enabled and disabled
                   options can be used to filter the set of rules displayed
                   to just those which are enabled or disabled respectfully.
           groups  Display the name of all of the rule groups that were
                   found on rulepath.  Each of the group names can be used
                   in place of the keyword <group> in this command syntax
                   description, which applies the command to all rules
                   within the rule group.
           status  Display status information relating to the current
                   pmieconf session, including a list of running pmie
                   processes which are currently using file.
           enable  { . | all | <rule> | <group> }
                   Enables the specified rule or group of rules.  An enabled
                   rule is one which will be included in the pmie
                   configuration file generated by pmieconf.  Any enabled
                   "actions" will be appended to the rule's "predicate", in
                   a manner conforming to the pmie syntax ("actions" can be
                   viewed using the list global command, described below).
           disable  { . | all | <rule> | <group> }
                   Disables the specified rule or group of rules.  If the
                   rule was previously enabled, it will be removed from the
                   pmie configuration file generated by pmieconf, and hence
                   no longer evaluated when pmie is restarted (using
                   pmieconf does not affect any existing pmie processes
                   using file).
           list  { . | all | global | <rule> | <group> } [<variable>]
                   Display the values for a specific rule variable; or for
                   all variables of a rule, a rule group, all rules, or the
                   global variables.
           modify  { . | all | global | <rule> | <group> } <variable>
           <value>
                   Enable, disable, or otherwise change the value for one or
                   more rule variables.  This value must be consistent with
                   the type of the variable, which can be inferred from the
                   format of the printed value - e.g. strings will be
                   enclosed in double-quotes, percentages have the ``%''
                   symbol appended, etc.  Note that certain rule variables
                   cannot be modified through pmieconf - "predicate" and
                   "help", for example.
           undo  { . | all | global | <rule> | <group> } [<variable>]
                   Applicable only to a variable whose value has been
                   modified - this command simply reverts to the default
                   value for the given variable.
           quit    Save any changes made to file and then exit pmieconf.
           abort   Exit pmieconf immediately without saving any changes to
                   file.
           Each of the commands above can be shortened by simply using the
           first character of the command name, and also ``?'' for help.
           Use of the all keyword causes the command to be applied to all of
           the rules.  The global keyword refers to those variables which
           are applied to every rule.  Such variables can be changed either
           globally or locally, for example:
             pmieconf> modify global delta "5 minutes"
             pmieconf> modify memory delta "1 minute"
           causes all rules to now be evaluated once every five minutes,
           except for rules in the "memory" group which are to be evaluated
           once per minute.
           The ``.'' character is special to pmieconf - it refers to the
           last successfully used value of all, global, <rule> or <group>.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Specify that all of the rules in the "memory" group should be
           evaluated:
             pmieconf> modify memory enabled yes
           Change your mind, and revert to using only the "memory" rules
           which were enabled by default:
             pmieconf> undo memory enabled
           Specify that notification of rules which evaluate to true should
           be sent to syslogd(1):
             pmieconf> modify global syslog_action yes
           Specify that rules in the "per_cpu" group should use a different
           holdoff value to other rules:
             pmieconf> help global holdoff
               rule: global  [generic parameters applied to all rules]
                var: holdoff
               help: Once the predicate is true and the action is executed,
                  this variable allows suppression of further action
                  execution until the specified interval has elapsed.
                  A value of zero enables execution of the action if
                  the rule predicate is true at the next sample. Default
                  units are seconds and common units are "second", "sec",
                  "minute", "min" and "hour".
             pmieconf> modify per_cpu holdoff "1 hour"
           Lower the threshold associated with a particular variable for a
           specified rule:
             pmieconf> l cpu.syscall predicate
               rule: cpu.syscall  [High aggregate system call rate]
                 predicate =
                      some_host (
                       ( kernel.all.syscall $hosts$ )
                         > $threshold$ count/sec * hinv.ncpu $hosts$
                      )
             pmieconf> m . threshold 7000
             pmieconf> l . threshold
               rule: cpu.syscall  [High aggregate system call rate]
                    threshold = 7000

## ENVIRONMENT         top
           The environment variable PMIECONF_PATH has a similar function to
           the -r option described above, and if set will be used provided
           no -r option is presented.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
