    PGREP(1)                      User Commands                     PGREP(1)
## NAME         top
           pgrep, pkill, pidwait - look up, signal, or wait for processes
           based on name and other attributes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pgrep [options] pattern
           pkill [options] pattern
           pidwait [options] pattern
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the
           process IDs which match the selection criteria to stdout.  All
           the criteria have to match.  For example,
                  $ pgrep -u root sshd
           will only list the processes called sshd AND owned by root.  On
           the other hand,
                  $ pgrep -u root,daemon
           will list the processes owned by root OR daemon.
           pkill will send the specified signal (by default SIGTERM) to each
           process instead of listing them on stdout.
           pidwait will wait for each process instead of listing them on
           stdout.
## OPTIONS         top
           -signal
           --signal signal
                  Defines the signal to send to each matched process.
                  Either the numeric or the symbolic signal name can be
                  used. In pgrep or pidwait mode only the long option can be
                  used and has no effect unless used in conjunction with
                  --require-handler to filter to processes with a userspace
                  signal handler present for a particular signal.
           -c, --count
                  Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching
                  processes.  When count does not match anything, e.g.
                  returns zero, the command will return non-zero value. Note
                  that for pkill and pidwait, the count is the number of
                  matching processes, not the processes that were
                  successfully signaled or waited for.
           -d, --delimiter delimiter
                  Sets the string used to delimit each process ID in the
                  output (by default a newline).  (pgrep only.)
           -e, --echo
                  Display name and PID of the process being killed.  (pkill
                  only.)
           -f, --full
                  The pattern is normally only matched against the process
                  name.  When -f is set, the full command line is used.
           -g, --pgroup pgrp,...
                  Only match processes in the process group IDs listed.
                  Process group 0 is translated into pgrep's, pkill's, or
                  pidwait's own process group.
           -G, --group gid,...
                  Only match processes whose real group ID is listed.
                  Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used.
           -i, --ignore-case
                  Match processes case-insensitively.
           -l, --list-name
                  List the process name as well as the process ID.  (pgrep
                  only.)
           -a, --list-full
                  List the full command line as well as the process ID.
                  (pgrep only.)
           -n, --newest
                  Select only the newest (most recently started) of the
                  matching processes.
           -o, --oldest
                  Select only the oldest (least recently started) of the
                  matching processes.
           -O, --older secs
                  Select processes older than secs.
           -P, --parent ppid,...
                  Only match processes whose parent process ID is listed.
           -s, --session sid,...
                  Only match processes whose process session ID is listed.
                  Session ID 0 is translated into pgrep's, pkill's, or
                  pidwait's own session ID.
           -t, --terminal term,...
                  Only match processes whose controlling terminal is listed.
                  The terminal name should be specified without the "/dev/"
                  prefix.
           -u, --euid euid,...
                  Only match processes whose effective user ID is listed.
                  Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used.
           -U, --uid uid,...
                  Only match processes whose real user ID is listed.  Either
                  the numerical or symbolical value may be used.
           -v, --inverse
                  Negates the matching.  This option is usually used in
                  pgrep's or pidwait's context.  In pkill's context the
                  short option is disabled to avoid accidental usage of the
                  option.
           -w, --lightweight
                  Shows all thread ids instead of pids in pgrep's or
                  pidwait's context.  In pkill's context this option is
                  disabled.
           -x, --exact
                  Only match processes whose names (or command lines if -f
                  is specified) exactly match the pattern.
           -F, --pidfile file
                  Read PIDs from file.  This option is more useful for pkill
                  or pidwait than pgrep.
           -L, --logpidfile
                  Fail if pidfile (see -F) not locked.
           -r, --runstates D,R,S,Z,...
                  Match only processes which match the process state.
           -A, --ignore-ancestors
                  Ignore all ancestors of pgrep, pkill, or pidwait.  For
                  example, this can be useful when elevating with sudo or
                  similar tools.
           -H, --require-handler
                  Only match processes with a userspace signal handler
                  present for the signal to be sent.
           --cgroup name,...
                  Match on provided control group (cgroup) v2 name. See
                  cgroups(8)
           --ns pid
                  Match processes that belong to the same namespaces.
                  Required to run as root to match processes from other
                  users. See --nslist for how to limit which namespaces to
                  match.
           --nslist name,...
                  Match only the provided namespaces. Available namespaces:
                  ipc, mnt, net, pid, user, uts.
           -q, --queue value
                  Use sigqueue(3) rather than kill(2) and the value argument
                  is used to specify an integer to be sent with the signal.
                  If the receiving process has installed a handler for this
                  signal using the SA_SIGINFO flag to sigaction(2), then it
                  can obtain this data via the si_value field of the
                  siginfo_t structure.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information and exit.
           -h, --help
                  Display help and exit.
## OPERANDS         top
           pattern
                  Specifies an Extended Regular Expression for matching
                  against the process names or command lines.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Example 1: Find the process ID of the named daemon:
                  $ pgrep -u root named
           Example 2: Make syslog reread its configuration file:
                  $ pkill -HUP syslogd
           Example 3: Give detailed information on all xterm processes:
                  $ ps -fp $(pgrep -d, -x xterm)
           Example 4: Make all chrome processes run nicer:
                  $ renice +4 $(pgrep chrome)
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0      One or more processes matched the criteria. For pkill and
                  pidwait, one or more processes must also have been
                  successfully signalled or waited for.
           1      No processes matched or none of them could be signalled.
           2      Syntax error in the command line.
           3      Fatal error: out of memory etc.
## NOTES         top
           The process name used for matching is limited to the 15
           characters present in the output of /proc/pid/stat.  Use the -f
           option to match against the complete command line,
           /proc/pid/cmdline. Threads may not have the same process name as
           the parent process but will have the same command line.
           The running pgrep, pkill, or pidwait process will never report
           itself as a match.
           The -O --older option will silently fail if /proc is mounted with
           the subset=pid option.
## BUGS         top
           The options -n and -o and -v can not be combined.  Let me know if
           you need to do this.
           Defunct processes are reported.
           pidwait requires the pidfd_open(2) system call which first
           appeared in Linux 5.3.
