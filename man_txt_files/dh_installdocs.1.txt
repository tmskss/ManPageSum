    DH_INSTALLDOCS(1)               Debhelper              DH_INSTALLDOCS(1)
## NAME         top
           dh_installdocs - install documentation into package build
           directories
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installdocs [debhelper options] [-A] [-Xitem] [file ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installdocs is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           installing documentation into usr/share/doc/package in package
           build directories.
           In compat 10 and earlier, dh_install(1) may be a better tool for
           handling the upstream documentation, when upstream's own build
           system installs all the desired documentation correctly.  In this
           case, dh_installdocs is still useful for installing packaging
           related documentation (e.g. the debian/copyright file).
           From debhelper compatibility level 11 on, dh_install will fall
           back to looking in debian/tmp for files, if it does not find them
           in the current directory (or wherever you've told it to look
           using --sourcedir).
           In compat 11 and later, dh_installdocs offers many of the
           features that dh_install(1) also has.  Furthermore,
           dh_installdocs also supports the nodoc build profile to exclude
           documentation (regardless of compat level).
## FILES         top
           debian/package.docs
               List documentation files to be installed into package.
               Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
               documented in debhelper(7).
           debian/copyright
               The copyright file is installed into all packages, unless a
               more specific copyright file is available.
           debian/package.copyright
           debian/package.README.Debian
           debian/package.TODO
               Each of these files is automatically installed if present for
               a package.
           debian/README.Debian
           debian/TODO
               These files are installed into the first binary package
               listed in debian/control.
               Note that README.debian files are also installed as
               README.Debian, and TODO files will be installed as
               TODO.Debian in non-native packages.
           debian/package.doc-base
               Installed as doc-base control files. Note that the doc-id
               will be determined from the Document: entry in the doc-base
               control file in question. In the event that multiple doc-base
               files in a single source package share the same doc-id, they
               will be installed to usr/share/doc-base/package instead of
               usr/share/doc-base/doc-id.
           debian/package.doc-base.*
               If your package needs to register more than one document, you
               need multiple doc-base files, and can name them like this. In
               the event that multiple doc-base files of this style in a
               single source package share the same doc-id, they will be
               installed to usr/share/doc-base/package-* instead of
               usr/share/doc-base/doc-id.
               Please be aware that this deduplication is currently done in
               memory only, so for now it requires dh_installdocs to be
               called no more than once during the package build. Calling
               dh_installdocs -ppackage in combination with using
               debian/package.doc-base.* files can lead to uninstallable
               packages. See <https://bugs.debian.org/980903> for details.
## OPTIONS         top
           -A, --all
               Install all files specified by command line parameters in ALL
               packages acted on.
           -Xitem, --exclude=item
               Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename
               from being installed. Note that this includes doc-base files.
           --sourcedir=dir
               Look in the specified directory for files to be installed.
               This option requires compat 11 or later (it is silently
               ignored in compat 10 or earlier).
               Note that this is not the same as the --sourcedirectory
               option used by the dh_auto_* commands. You rarely need to use
               this option, since dh_installman automatically looks for
               files in debian/tmp in debhelper compatibility level 11 and
               above.
           --doc-main-package=main-package
               Set the main package for a documentation package.  This is
               used to install the documentation of the documentation
               package in /usr/share/doc/main-package as recommended by the
               Debian policy manual 3.9.7 in §12.3.
               In compat 11 (or later), this option is only useful if
               debhelper's auto-detection of the main package is wrong.  The
               option can also be used to silence a warning from debhelper
               when the auto-detection fails but the default happens to be
               correct.
               This option cannot be used when dh_installdocs is instructed
               to act on multiple packages.  If you need this option, you
               will generally need to combine it with -p to ensure exactly
               one package is acted on.
               Please keep in mind that some documentation (the copyright
               file, README.Debian, etc.) will be unaffected by this option.
           --link-doc=package
               Make the documentation directory of all packages acted on be
               a symlink to the documentation directory of package. This has
               no effect when acting on package itself, or if the
               documentation directory to be created already exists when
               dh_installdocs is run. To comply with policy, package must be
               a binary package that comes from the same source package.
               debhelper will try to avoid installing files into linked
               documentation directories that would cause conflicts with the
               linked package. The -A option will have no effect on packages
               with linked documentation directories, and copyright,
               changelog, README.Debian, and TODO files will not be
               installed.
               (An older method to accomplish the same thing, which is still
               supported, is to make the documentation directory of a
               package be a dangling symlink, before calling
               dh_installdocs.)
               Please note that this option only applies to the
               documentation directory for the package itself.  When the
               package ships documentation for another package (e.g. see
               --doc-main-package), it will not use a symlink for the
               documentation of the other package.
               CAVEAT 1: If a previous version of the package was built
               without this option and is now built with it (or vice-versa),
               it requires a "dir to symlink" (or "symlink to dir")
               migration.  Since debhelper has no knowledge of previous
               versions, you have to enable this migration itself.
               This can be done by providing a "debian/package.maintscript"
               file and using dh_installdeb(1) to provide the relevant
               maintainer script snippets.
               CAVEAT 2: The use of --link-doc should only be done when the
               packages have same "architecture" type.  A link from an
               architecture independent package to an architecture dependent
               package (or vice versa) will not work.  Since compat 10,
               debhelper will actively reject unsupported combinations.
           file ...
               Install these files as documentation into the first package
               acted on. (Or in all packages if -A is specified).
## EXAMPLES         top
           This is an example of a debian/package.docs file:
             README
             TODO
             debian/notes-for-maintainers.txt
             docs/manual.txt
             docs/manual.pdf
             docs/manual-html/
## NOTES         top
           Note that dh_installdocs will happily copy entire directory
           hierarchies if you ask it to (similar to cp -a). If it is asked
           to install a directory, it will install the complete contents of
           the directory.
