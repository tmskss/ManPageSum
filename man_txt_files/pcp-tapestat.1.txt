## NAME         top
           pcp-tapestat - report tape I/O statistics
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] tapestat [-u?]  [-G method] [-P precision] [-R
           pattern] [-x [t][,h][,noidle]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-tapestat reports I/O statistics for tape devices.
## OPTIONS         top
           When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the pcp options -A/--align,
           -a/--archive, -h/--host, -O/--origin, -S/--start, -s/--samples,
           -t/--interval, -T/--finish, -V/--version, -Z/--timezone and
           -z/--hostzone become indirectly available; refer to PCPIntro(1)
           for a complete description of these options.
           The additional command line options available for pcp-tapestat
           are:
           -G method, --aggregate=method
                Specifies that statistics for device names matching the
                regular expression specified with the -R regex option should
                be aggregated according to method.  Note this is aggregation
                based on matching device names (not temporal aggregation).
                When -G is used, the device name column is reported as
                method(regex), e.g.  if -G sum -R 'st(0|1)$' is specified,
                the device column will be sum(st(0|1)$) and summed
                statistics for st0 and st1 will be reported in the remaining
                columns.  If -G is specified but -R is not specified, then
                the default regex is .*, i.e. matching all device names.  If
                method is sum then the statistics are summed.  If method is
                avg then the statistics are summed and then averaged by
                dividing by the number of matching device names.  If method
                is min or max, the minimum or maximum statistics for
                matching devices are reported, respectively.
           -P N, --precision=N
                This indicates the precision (number of decimal places) to
                report.  The default precision N may be set to something
                other than the default (2).  Note that the avgrq-sz and
                avgqu-sz fields are always reported with N+1 decimals of
                precision.  These fields typically have values less than 1.
           -R pattern, --regex=pattern
                This restricts the report to device names matching a regular
                expression pattern.  The given pattern is searched as a perl
                style regular expression, and will match any portion of a
                device name.  e.g. '^st[0-9]+' will match all device names
                starting with 'st' followed by one or more numbers.  e.g.
                '^st(0|1)$' will only match 'st0' and 'st1'.  e.g. 'st0$'
                will match 'st0' but not 'st1'.  See also the -G option for
                aggregation options.
           -u, --no-interpolation
                When replaying a set of archives, by default values are
                reported according to the requested sample interval (-t
                option), not according to the actual interval recorded in
                the archive(s).  Without this option PCP interpolates the
                values to be reported based on the records in the set of
                archives, which is particularly useful when the -t option is
                used to replay a set of archives with a longer sampling
                interval than that with which the archive(s) was originally
                recorded with.  With the -u option, uninterpolated reporting
                is enabled - every value is reported according to the native
                recording interval in the set of archives.  When the -u
                option is specified, the -t option makes no sense and is
                incompatible because the replay interval is always the same
                as the recording interval in the set of archive.  In
                addition, -u only makes sense when replaying archives, see
                the -a option on PCPIntro(1), and so if -u is specified then
                -a must also be specified.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -x comma-separated-options
                Specifies a comma-separated list of one or more extended
                reporting options as follows:
                t - prefix every line in the report with a timestamp in
                ctime(3) format,
                h - omit the heading, which is otherwise reported every 24
                samples,
                noidle - Do not display statistics for idle devices.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## REPORT         top
           The columns in the pcp-tapestat report have the following
           interpretation:
           Timestamp
                  When the -x t option is specified, this column is the
                  timestamp in ctime(3) format.
           Device Specifies the tape device name.  When -G is specified,
                  this is replaced by the aggregation method and regular
                  expression - see the -G and -R options above.
           r/s    The number of reads issued expressed as the number per
                  second averaged over the interval.
           w/s    The number of writes issued expressed as the number per
                  second averaged over the interval.
           kb_r/s The amount of data read expressed in kilobytes per second
                  averaged over the interval.
           kb_w/s The amount of data written expressed in kilobytes per
                  second averaged over the interval.
           r_pct  Read percentage wait - the percentage of time over the
                  interval spent waiting for read requests to complete.  The
                  time is measured from when the request is dispatched to
                  the SCSI mid-layer until it signals that it completed.
           w_pct  Write percentage wait - the percentage of time over the
                  interval spent waiting for write requests to complete.
                  The time is measured from when the request is dispatched
                  to the SCSI mid-layer until it signals that it completed.
           o_pct  Overall percentage wait - the percentage of time over the
                  interval spent waiting for any I/O request to complete
                  (read, write, and other).
           Rs/s   The number of I/Os, expressed as the number per second
                  averaged over the interval, where a non-zero residual
                  value was encountered.
           o_cnt  The  number of I/Os, expressed as the number per second
                  averaged over the interval, that were included as "other".
                  Other I/O includes ioctl calls made to the tape driver and
                  implicit operations performed by the tape driver such as
                  rewind on close (for tape devices that implement rewind on
                  close).  It does not include any I/O performed using
                  methods outside of the tape driver (e.g. via sg ioctls).
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
