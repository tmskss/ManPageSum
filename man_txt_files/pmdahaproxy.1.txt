## NAME         top
           pmdahaproxy - HAProxy PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdahaproxy is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts live performance data from HAProxy statistics socket or
           URL.
           By default the HAProxy stats socket is used to retrieve the
           metric but if the optional URL option is set (see below), then
           the HAProxy URL is used instead.
           See the HAProxy documentation for detailed description of each
           metric.
## INSTALLATION         top
           pmdahaproxy reads an optional ini-style configuration file
               • $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/haproxy/haproxy.conf
           This file can contain in its [pmda] section overriding values for
           the following PMDA options:
               • user
               • socket
           By default, root and /var/lib/haproxy/stats, are used as values
           for these options, respectively.
           The section can also contain the following parameters:
               • url
               • auth
               • pass
           When the url option is defined, URL connection to HAProxy is
           used.  pmdahaproxy expects CSV data from the HAProxy URL; an
           example of a compatible URL is http://127.0.0.1:9000/?stats;csv .
           Note that the HAProxy statistics socket and/or URL need to be
           separately enabled in the HAProxy configuration file; please
           refer to the HAProxy configuration documentation for details.
           Depending on system and HAProxy configuration, using non-root
           user may also be possible, especially with URL based connections.
           Once the needed setup is ready, you can test the connection and
           install the PMDA to enable access to the names and values for the
           HAProxy performance metrics.  To install, do the following as
           root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/haproxy
               # ./connect
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/haproxy
               # ./Remove
           pmdahaproxy is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
