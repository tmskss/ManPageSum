## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           unget — undo a previous get of an SCCS file (DEVELOPMENT)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           unget [-ns] [-r SID] file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The unget utility shall reverse the effect of a get -e done prior
           to creating the intended new delta.
## OPTIONS         top
           The unget utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -r SID    Uniquely identify which delta is no longer intended.
                     (This would have been specified by get as the new
                     delta.) The use of this option is necessary only if two
                     or more outstanding get commands for editing on the
                     same SCCS file were done by the same person (login
                     name).
           -s        Suppress the writing to standard output of the intended
                     delta's SID.
           -n        Retain the file that was obtained by get, which would
                     normally be removed from the current directory.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of an existing SCCS file or a directory. If
                     file is a directory, the unget utility shall behave as
                     though each file in the directory were specified as a
                     named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component
                     of the pathname does not begin with s.)  and unreadable
                     files shall be silently ignored.
                     If exactly one file operand appears, and it is '-', the
                     standard input shall be read; each line of the standard
                     input shall be taken to be the name of an SCCS file to
                     be processed. Non-SCCS files and unreadable files shall
                     be silently ignored.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be a text file used only when the file
           operand is specified as '-'.  Each line of the text file shall be
           interpreted as an SCCS pathname.
## INPUT FILES         top
           Any SCCS files processed shall be files of an unspecified format.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           unget:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The standard output shall consist of a line for each file, in the
           following format:
               "%s\n", <SID removed from file>
           If there is more than one named file or if a directory or
           standard input is named, each pathname shall be written before
           each of the preceding lines:
               "\n%s:\n", <pathname>
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           Any SCCS files updated shall be files of an unspecified format.
           During processing of a file, a locking z-file, as described in
           get, and a q-file (a working copy of the p-file), may be created
           and deleted. The p-file and g-file, as described in get, shall be
           deleted.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
