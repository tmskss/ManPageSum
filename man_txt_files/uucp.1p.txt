## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           uucp — system-to-system copy
## SYNOPSIS         top
           uucp [-cCdfjmr] [-n user] source-file... destination-file
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The uucp utility shall copy files named by the source-file
           argument to the destination-file argument. The files named can be
           on local or remote systems.
           The uucp utility cannot guarantee support for all character
           encodings in all circumstances. For example, transmission data
           may be restricted to 7 bits by the underlying network, 8-bit data
           and filenames need not be portable to non-internationalized
           systems, and so on. Under these circumstances, it is recommended
           that only characters defined in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
           International Reference Version (equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range
           of characters be used, and that only characters defined in the
           portable filename character set be used for naming files. The
           protocol for transfer of files is unspecified by POSIX.1‐2008.
           Typical implementations of this utility require a communications
           line configured to use the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface, but other
           communications means may be used. On systems where there are no
           available communications means (either temporarily or
           permanently), this utility shall write an error message
           describing the problem and exit with a non-zero exit status.
## OPTIONS         top
           The uucp utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -c        Do not copy local file to the spool directory for
                     transfer to the remote machine (default).
           -C        Force the copy of local files to the spool directory
                     for transfer.
           -d        Make all necessary directories for the file copy
                     (default).
           -f        Do not make intermediate directories for the file copy.
           -j        Write the job identification string to standard output.
                     This job identification can be used by uustat to obtain
                     the status or terminate a job.
           -m        Send mail to the requester when the copy is completed.
           -n user   Notify user on the remote system that a file was sent.
           -r        Do not start the file transfer; just queue the job.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           destination-file, source-file
                     A pathname of a file to be copied to, or from,
                     respectively. Either name can be a pathname on the
                     local machine, or can have the form:
                         system-name!pathname
                     where system-name is taken from a list of system names
                     that uucp knows about.  The destination system-name can
                     also be a list of names such as:
                         system-name!system-name!...!system-name!pathname
                     in which case, an attempt is made to send the file via
                     the specified route to the destination. Care should be
                     taken to ensure that intermediate nodes in the route
                     are willing to forward information.
                     The shell pattern matching notation characters '?',
                     '*', and "[...]" appearing in pathname shall be
                     expanded on the appropriate system.
                     Pathnames can be one of:
                      1. An absolute pathname.
                      2. A pathname preceded by ~user where user is a login
                         name on the specified system and is replaced by
                         that user's login directory. Note that if an
                         invalid login is specified, the default is to the
                         public directory (called PUBDIR; the actual
                         location of PUBDIR is implementation-defined).
                      3. A pathname preceded by ~/destination where
                         destination is appended to PUBDIR.
                         Note:  This destination is treated as a filename
                                unless more than one file is being
                                transferred by this request or the
                                destination is already a directory. To
                                ensure that it is a directory, follow the
                                destination with a '/'.  For example, ~/dan/
                                as the destination makes the directory
                                PUBDIR/dan if it does not exist and puts the
                                requested files in that directory.
                      4. Anything else shall be prefixed by the current
                         directory.
                     If the result is an erroneous pathname for the remote
                     system, the copy shall fail. If the destination-file is
                     a directory, the last part of the source-file name
                     shall be used.
                     The read, write, and execute permissions given by uucp
                     are implementation-defined.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The files to be copied are regular files.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           uucp:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_COLLATE
                     Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                     equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                     elements within bracketed filename patterns.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files) and the
                     behavior of character classes within bracketed filename
                     patterns (for example, "'[[:lower:]]*'").
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error, and informative messages written to
                     standard output.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           The output files (which may be on other systems) are copies of
           the input files.
           If -m is used, mail files are modified.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           This utility is part of the UUCP Utilities option and need not be
           supported by all implementations.
           The domain of remotely accessible files can (and for obvious
           security reasons usually should) be severely restricted.
           Note that the '!'  character in addresses has to be escaped when
           using csh as a command interpreter because of its history
           substitution syntax.  For ksh and sh the escape is not necessary,
           but may be used.
           As noted above, shell metacharacters appearing in pathnames are
           expanded on the appropriate system. On an internationalized
           system, this is done under the control of local settings of
           LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE.  Thus, care should be taken when using
           bracketed filename patterns, as collation and typing rules may
           vary from one system to another. Also be aware that certain types
           of expression (that is, equivalence classes, character classes,
           and collating symbols) need not be supported on non-
           internationalized systems.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
