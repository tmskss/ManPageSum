## NAME         top
           ipcrm - remove certain IPC resources
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ipcrm [options]
           ipcrm [shm|msg|sem] ID ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ipcrm removes System V inter-process communication (IPC) objects
           and associated data structures from the system. In order to
           delete such objects, you must be superuser, or the creator or
           owner of the object.
           System V IPC objects are of three types: shared memory, message
           queues, and semaphores. Deletion of a message queue or semaphore
           object is immediate (regardless of whether any process still
           holds an IPC identifier for the object). A shared memory object
           is only removed after all currently attached processes have
           detached (shmdt(2)) the object from their virtual address space.
           Two syntax styles are supported. The old Linux historical syntax
           specifies a three-letter keyword indicating which class of object
           is to be deleted, followed by one or more IPC identifiers for
           objects of this type.
           The SUS-compliant syntax allows the specification of zero or more
           objects of all three types in a single command line, with objects
           specified either by key or by identifier (see below). Both keys
           and identifiers may be specified in decimal, hexadecimal
           (specified with an initial '0x' or '0X'), or octal (specified
           with an initial '0').
           The details of the removes are described in shmctl(2), msgctl(2),
           and semctl(2). The identifiers and keys can be found by using
           ipcs(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           -a, --all [shm] [msg] [sem]
               Remove all resources. When an option argument is provided,
               the removal is performed only for the specified resource
               types.
               Warning! Do not use -a if you are unsure how the software
               using the resources might react to missing objects. Some
               programs create these resources at startup and may not have
               any code to deal with an unexpected disappearance.
           -M, --shmem-key shmkey
               Remove the shared memory segment created with shmkey after
               the last detach is performed.
           -m, --shmem-id shmid
               Remove the shared memory segment identified by shmid after
               the last detach is performed.
           -Q, --queue-key msgkey
               Remove the message queue created with msgkey.
           -q, --queue-id msgid
               Remove the message queue identified by msgid.
           -S, --semaphore-key semkey
               Remove the semaphore created with semkey.
           -s, --semaphore-id semid
               Remove the semaphore identified by semid.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## NOTES         top
           In its first Linux implementation, ipcrm used the deprecated
           syntax shown in the second line of the SYNOPSIS. Functionality
           present in other *nix implementations of ipcrm has since been
           added, namely the ability to delete resources by key (not just
           identifier), and to respect the same command-line syntax. For
           backward compatibility the previous syntax is still supported.
