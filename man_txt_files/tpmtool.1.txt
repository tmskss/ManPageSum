## NAME         top
           tpmtool - GnuTLS TPM tool
## SYNOPSIS         top
           tpmtool [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]
           All arguments must be options.
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Program that allows handling cryptographic data from the TPM
           chip.
## OPTIONS         top
           -d num, --debug=num
                  Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as
                  its argument.  The value of num is constrained to being:
                      in the range 0 through 9999
                  Specifies the debug level.
           --infile=file
                  Input file.
           --outfile=str
                  Output file.
           --generate-rsa
                  Generate an RSA private-public key pair.
                  Generates an RSA private-public key pair in the TPM chip.
                  The key may be stored in file system and protected by a
                  PIN, or stored (registered) in the TPM chip flash.
           --register
                  Any generated key will be registered in the TPM.  This
                  option must appear in combination with the following
                  options: generate-rsa.
           --signing
                  Any generated key will be a signing key.  This option must
                  not appear in combination with any of the following
                  options: legacy.  This option must appear in combination
                  with the following options: generate-rsa.
           --legacy
                  Any generated key will be a legacy key.  This option must
                  not appear in combination with any of the following
                  options: signing.  This option must appear in combination
                  with the following options: generate-rsa.
           --user Any registered key will be a user key.  This option must
                  not appear in combination with any of the following
                  options: system.  This option must appear in combination
                  with the following options: register.
                  The generated key will be stored in a user specific
                  persistent storage.
           --system
                  Any registered key will be a system key.  This option must
                  not appear in combination with any of the following
                  options: user.  This option must appear in combination
                  with the following options: register.
                  The generated key will be stored in system persistent
                  storage.
           --pubkey=url
                  Prints the public key of the provided key.
           --list Lists all stored keys in the TPM.
           --delete=url
                  Delete the key identified by the given URL (UUID).
           --test-sign=url
                  Tests the signature operation of the provided object.
                  It can be used to test the correct operation of the
                  signature operation.  This operation will sign and verify
                  the signed data.
           --sec-param=security parameter
                  Specify the security level [low, legacy, medium, high,
                  ultra].
                  This is alternative to the bits option. Note however that
                  the values allowed by the TPM chip are quantized and given
                  values may be rounded up.
           --bits=num
                  Specify the number of bits for key generate.  This option
                  takes an integer number as its argument.
           --inder, --no-inder
                  Use the DER format for keys.  The no-inder form will
                  disable the option.
                  The input files will be assumed to be in the portable DER
                  format of TPM. The default format is a custom format used
                  by various TPM tools
           --outder, --no-outder
                  Use DER format for output keys.  The no-outder form will
                  disable the option.
                  The output will be in the TPM portable DER format.
           --srk-well-known
                  SRK has well known password (20 bytes of zeros).
           -v arg, --version=arg
                  Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is
                  `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright
                  information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.
           -h, --help
                  Display usage information and exit.
           -!, --more-help
                  Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
## EXAMPLES         top
           To generate a key that is to be stored in file system use:
               $ tpmtool --generate-rsa --bits 2048 --outfile tpmkey.pem
           To generate a key that is to be stored in TPM's flash use:
               $ tpmtool --generate-rsa --bits 2048 --register --user
           To get the public key of a TPM key use:
               $ tpmtool --pubkey tpmkey:uuid=58ad734b-bde6-45c7-89d8-756a55ad1891;storage=user           --outfile pubkey.pem
           or if the key is stored in the file system:
               $ tpmtool --pubkey tpmkey:file=tmpkey.pem --outfile pubkey.pem
           To list all keys stored in TPM use:
               $ tpmtool --list
## EXIT STATUS         top
           One of the following exit values will be returned:
           0  (EXIT_SUCCESS)
                  Successful program execution.
           1  (EXIT_FAILURE)
                  The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
