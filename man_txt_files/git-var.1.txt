    GIT-VAR(1)                     Git Manual                     GIT-VAR(1)
## NAME         top
           git-var - Show a Git logical variable
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git var (-l | <variable>)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Prints a Git logical variable. Exits with code 1 if the variable
           has no value.
## OPTIONS         top
           -l
               Cause the logical variables to be listed. In addition, all
               the variables of the Git configuration file .git/config are
               listed as well. (However, the configuration variables listing
               functionality is deprecated in favor of git config -l.)
## EXAMPLES         top
               $ git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT

## VARIABLES         top
           GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT
               The author of a piece of code.
           GIT_COMMITTER_IDENT
               The person who put a piece of code into Git.
           GIT_EDITOR
               Text editor for use by Git commands. The value is meant to be
               interpreted by the shell when it is used. Examples: ~/bin/vi,
               $SOME_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE, "C:\Program Files\Vim\gvim.exe"
               --nofork. The order of preference is the $GIT_EDITOR
               environment variable, then core.editor configuration, then
               $VISUAL, then $EDITOR, and then the default chosen at compile
               time, which is usually vi.
           GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR
               Text editor used to edit the todo file while running git
               rebase -i. Like GIT_EDITOR, the value is meant to be
               interpreted by the shell when it is used. The order of
               preference is the $GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR environment variable,
               then sequence.editor configuration, and then the value of git
               var GIT_EDITOR.
           GIT_PAGER
               Text viewer for use by Git commands (e.g., less). The value
               is meant to be interpreted by the shell. The order of
               preference is the $GIT_PAGER environment variable, then
               core.pager configuration, then $PAGER, and then the default
               chosen at compile time (usually less).
           GIT_DEFAULT_BRANCH
               The name of the first branch created in newly initialized
               repositories.
