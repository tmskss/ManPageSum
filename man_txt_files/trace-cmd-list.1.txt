## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-list - list available plugins, events or options for
           Ftrace.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd list [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) list displays the available plugins, events or
           Ftrace options that are configured on the current machine. If no
           option is given, then it lists all plugins, event systems, events
           and Ftrace options to standard output.
## OPTIONS         top
           -e [regex]
               This option will list the available events that are enabled
               on the local system.
                   It takes an optional argument that uses 'regcomp(3)' expressions to seach.
                   trace-cmd list -e '^sys.*'
           -F
               Used with -e regex to show the fields of the event.
           --full
               Used with -F which will show the "print fmt" of the event
               along with the fields.
           -l
               Used with -e regex to show those events filters.
           -R
               Used with -e regex to show those events triggers.
           -s
               This option will list the available event systems.
           -t
               This option will list the available tracers that are enabled
               on the local system.
           -p
               Same as -t and only for legacy purposes.
           -o
               This option will list the available Ftrace options that are
               configured on the local system.
           -f [regex]
               This option will list the available filter functions. These
               are the list of functions on the system that you can trace,
               or filter on. It takes an optional argument that uses
               regcomp(3) expressions to seach.
                   trace-cmd list -f '^sched.*'
           -P
               List the plugin files that get loaded on trace-cmd report.
           -O
               List plugin options that can be used by trace-cmd report -O
               option.
           -B
               List defined buffer instances (sub buffers).
           -C
               List defined clocks that can be used with trace-cmd record
               -C. The one in brackets ([]) is the active clock.
           -c
               List the available trace file compression algorithms.
