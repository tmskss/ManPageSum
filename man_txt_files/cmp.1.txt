## NAME         top
           cmp - compare two files byte by byte
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cmp [OPTION]... FILE1 [FILE2 [SKIP1 [SKIP2]]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Compare two files byte by byte.
           The optional SKIP1 and SKIP2 specify the number of bytes to skip
           at the beginning of each file (zero by default).
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -b, --print-bytes
                  print differing bytes
           -i, --ignore-initial=SKIP
                  skip first SKIP bytes of both inputs
           -i, --ignore-initial=SKIP1:SKIP2
                  skip first SKIP1 bytes of FILE1 and first SKIP2 bytes of
                  FILE2
           -l, --verbose
                  output byte numbers and differing byte values
           -n, --bytes=LIMIT
                  compare at most LIMIT bytes
           -s, --quiet, --silent
                  suppress all normal output
           --help display this help and exit
           -v, --version
                  output version information and exit
           SKIP values may be followed by the following multiplicative
           suffixes: kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1,000,000, M 1,048,576, GB
           1,000,000,000, G 1,073,741,824, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.
           If a FILE is '-' or missing, read standard input.  Exit status is
           0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.

           The full documentation for cmp is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
           If the info and cmp programs are properly installed at your site,
           the command
                  info cmp
           should give you access to the complete manual.
