    DH_GENCONTROL(1)                Debhelper               DH_GENCONTROL(1)
## NAME         top
           dh_gencontrol - generate and install control file
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_gencontrol [debhelper options] [-- params]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_gencontrol is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           generating control files, and installing them into the DEBIAN
           directory with the proper permissions.
           This program is merely a wrapper around dpkg-gencontrol(1), which
           calls it once for each package being acted on (plus related
           dbgsym packages), and passes in some additional useful flags.
           Note that if you use dh_gencontrol, you must also use
           dh_builddeb(1) to build the packages.  Otherwise, your build may
           fail to build as dh_gencontrol (via dpkg-gencontrol(1)) declares
           which packages are built.  As debhelper automatically generates
           dbgsym packages, it some times adds additional packages, which
           will be built by dh_builddeb(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           -- params
               Pass params to dpkg-gencontrol(1).
           -uparams, --dpkg-gencontrol-params=params
               This is another way to pass params to dpkg-gencontrol(1).  It
               is deprecated; use -- instead.
## SEE ALSO         top
           debhelper(7)
           This program is a part of debhelper.
