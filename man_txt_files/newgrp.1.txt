    NEWGRP(1)                     User Commands                    NEWGRP(1)
## NAME         top
           newgrp - log in to a new group
## SYNOPSIS         top
           newgrp [-] [group]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The newgrp command is used to change the current group ID during
           a login session. If the optional - flag is given, the user's
           environment will be reinitialized as though the user had logged
           in, otherwise the current environment, including current working
           directory, remains unchanged.
           newgrp changes the current real group ID to the named group, or
           to the default group listed in /etc/passwd if no group name is
           given.  newgrp also tries to add the group to the user groupset.
           If not root, the user will be prompted for a password if she does
           not have a password (in /etc/shadow if this user has an entry in
           the shadowed password file, or in /etc/passwd otherwise) and the
           group does, or if the user is not listed as a member and the
           group has a password. The user will be denied access if the group
           password is empty and the user is not listed as a member.
           If there is an entry for this group in /etc/gshadow, then the
           list of members and the password of this group will be taken from
           this file, otherwise, the entry in /etc/group is considered.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
           the behavior of this tool:
           SYSLOG_SG_ENAB (boolean)
               Enable "syslog" logging of sg activity.
## FILES         top
           /etc/passwd
               User account information.
           /etc/shadow
               Secure user account information.
           /etc/group
               Group account information.
           /etc/gshadow
               Secure group account information.
## SEE ALSO         top
