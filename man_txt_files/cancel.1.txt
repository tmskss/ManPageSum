## NAME         top
           cancel - cancel jobs
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cancel [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -a ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -u
           username ] [ -x ] [ id ] [ destination ] [ destination-id ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The cancel command cancels print jobs.  If no destination or id
           is specified, the currently printing job on the default
           destination is canceled.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are recognized by cancel:
           -a   Cancel all jobs on the named destination, or all jobs on all
                destinations if none is provided.
           -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.
           -h hostname[:port]
                Specifies an alternate server.
           -U username
                Specifies the username to use when connecting to the server.
           -u username
                Cancels jobs owned by username.
           -x   Deletes job data files in addition to canceling.
## CONFORMING TO         top
           Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to
           contain any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".
           Also, printer and class names are not case-sensitive.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Cancel the current print job:
               cancel
           Cancel job "myprinter-42":
               cancel myprinter-42
           Cancel all jobs:
               cancel -a
## NOTES         top
           Administrators wishing to prevent unauthorized cancellation of
           jobs via the -u option should require authentication for Cancel-
           Jobs operations in cupsd.conf(5).
