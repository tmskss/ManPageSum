## NAME         top
           tload - graphic representation of system load average
## SYNOPSIS         top
           tload [options] [tty]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           tload prints a graph of the current system load average to the
           specified tty (or the tty of the tload process if none is
           specified).
## OPTIONS         top
           -s, --scale number
                  The scale option allows a vertical scale to be specified
                  for the display (in characters between graph ticks); thus,
                  a smaller value represents a larger scale, and vice versa.
           -d, --delay seconds
                  The delay sets the delay between graph updates in seconds.
           -h, --help
                  Display this help text.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information and exit.
## FILES         top
           /proc/loadavg load average information
## SEE ALSO         top
           ps(1), top(1), uptime(1), w(1)
## BUGS         top
           The -d delay option sets the time argument for an alarm(2); if -d
           0 is specified, the alarm is set to 0, which will never send the
           SIGALRM and update the display.
