## NAME         top
           pmie2col - convert pmie output to multi-column format
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmie2col [-?]  [-d delimiter] [-p precision] [-w width]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmie2col is a simple tool that converts output from pmie(1) into
           regular column format.  Each column is 7 characters wide (by
           default, may be changed with the -w option) with a single space
           between columns.  That single space can be substituted with an
           alternate delimiter using the -d option (this is useful for
           importing the data into a spreadsheet, for example).
           The precision of the tabulated values from pmie can be specified
           with the -p option (default is 2 decimal places).  This option
           can and will override any width setting in order to present the
           requested precision.
           The pmie(1) configuration must follow these rules:
           (1)    Each pmie(1) expression is of the form ``NAME = expr;''.
                  NAME will be used as the column heading, and must contain
                  no white space, although special characters can be escaped
                  by enclosing NAME in single quotes.
           (2)    The ``expr'' must be a valid pmie(1) expression that
                  produces a singular value.
           In addition, pmie(1) must be run with the -v command line option.
           It is also possible to use the -e command line to pmie(1) and
           output lines will be prefixed by a timestamp.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -d char, --delimiter=char
                Use char as output delimiter.
           -p N, --precision=N
                Use n as output floating point precision.
           -w N, --width=N
                Use n as output column width.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Given this pmie(1) configuration file (config):
                loadav = kernel.all.load #'1 minute';
                '%usr' = kernel.all.cpu.user;
                '%sys' = kernel.all.cpu.sys;
                '%wio' = kernel.all.cpu.wait.total;
                '%idle' = kernel.all.cpu.idle;
                'max-iops' = max_inst(disk.dev.total);
           Then this command pipeline:
                $ pmie -v -t 5 <config | pmie2col -w 8
           Produces output like this:
                   loadav     %usr     %sys     %wio    %idle max-iops

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
