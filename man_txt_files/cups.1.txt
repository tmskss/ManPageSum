## NAME         top
           cups - a standards-based, open source printing system
## DESCRIPTION         top
           CUPS is the software you use to print from applications like word
           processors, email readers, photo editors, and web browsers. It
           converts the page descriptions produced by your application (put
           a paragraph here, draw a line there, and so forth) into something
           your printer can understand and then sends the information to the
           printer for printing.
           Now, since every printer manufacturer does things differently,
           printing can be very complicated.  CUPS does its best to hide
           this from you and your application so that you can concentrate on
           printing and less on how to print. Generally, the only time you
           need to know anything about your printer is when you use it for
           the first time, and even then CUPS can often figure things out on
           its own.
       HOW DOES IT WORK?
           The first time you print to a printer, CUPS creates a queue to
           keep track of the current status of the printer (everything OK,
           out of paper, etc.) and any pages you have printed. Most of the
           time the queue points to a printer connected directly to your
           computer via a USB port, however it can also point to a printer
           on your network, a printer on the Internet, or multiple printers
           depending on the configuration. Regardless of where the queue
           points, it will look like any other printer to you and your
           applications.
           Every time you print something, CUPS creates a job which contains
           the queue you are sending the print to, the name of the document
           you are printing, and the page descriptions. Job are numbered
           (queue-1, queue-2, and so forth) so you can monitor the job as it
           is printed or cancel it if you see a mistake. When CUPS gets a
           job for printing, it determines the best programs (filters,
           printer drivers, port monitors, and backends) to convert the
           pages into a printable format and then runs them to actually
           print the job.
           When the print job is completely printed, CUPS removes the job
           from the queue and moves on to any other jobs you have submitted.
           You can also be notified when the job is finished, or if there
           are any errors during printing, in several different ways.
       WHERE DO I BEGIN?
           The easiest way to start is by using the web interface to
           configure your printer. Go to "http://localhost:631" and choose
           the Administration tab at the top of the page. Click/press on the
           Add Printer button and follow the prompts.
           When you are asked for a username and password, enter your login
           username and password or the "root" username and password.
           After the printer is added you will be asked to set the default
           printer options (paper size, output mode, etc.) for the printer.
           Make any changes as needed and then click/press on the Set
           Default Options button to save them. Some printers also support
           auto-configuration - click/press on the Query Printer for Default
           Options button to update the options automatically.
           Once you have added the printer, you can print to it from any
           application. You can also choose Print Test Page from the
           maintenance menu to print a simple test page and verify that
           everything is working properly.
           You can also use the lpadmin(8) and lpinfo(8) commands to add
           printers to CUPS.  Additionally, your operating system may
           include graphical user interfaces or automatically create printer
           queues when you connect a printer to your computer.
       HOW DO I GET HELP?
           The CUPS web site (http://www.CUPS.org) provides access to the
           cups and cups-devel mailing lists, additional documentation and
           resources, and a bug report database. Most vendors also provide
           online discussion forums to ask printing questions for your
           operating system of choice.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           CUPS commands use the following environment variables to override
           the default locations of files and so forth. For security
           reasons, these environment variables are ignored for setuid
           programs:
           CUPS_ANYROOT
                Whether to allow any X.509 certificate root (Y or N).
           CUPS_CACHEDIR

                scheduler (hostname:port or ipaddress:port).
           CUPS_SERVERBIN
                The directory where server helper programs, filters,
                backend, etc. can be found.
           CUPS_SERVERROOT
                The root directory of the server.
           CUPS_STATEDIR

## FILES         top
           ~/.cups/client.conf

## CONFORMING TO         top
           CUPS conforms to the Internet Printing Protocol version 2.1 and
           implements the Berkeley and System V UNIX print commands.
## NOTES         top
           CUPS printer drivers, backends, and PPD files are deprecated and
           will no longer be supported in a future feature release of CUPS.
           Printers that do not support IPP can be supported using
           applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
