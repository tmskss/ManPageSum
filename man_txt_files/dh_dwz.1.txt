## NAME         top
           dh_dwz - optimize DWARF debug information in ELF binaries via dwz
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_dwz [debhelper options] [-Xitem] [-- params]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_dwz is a debhelper program that will optimize the
           (uncompressed) size of the DWARF debug information in ELF
           binaries.  It does so by running dwz(1) on all the ELF binaries
           in the package.
## OPTIONS         top
           --dwz-multifile, --no-dwz-multifile
               Whether dwz(1) should generate a multifile from the ELF
               binaries in the same package.  When enabled, if a package
               ships at least 2 ELF binaries, dh_dwz will instruct dwz(1) to
               generate a multifile for the package.
               By default, dh_dwz will attempt to create a multifile but
               will continue without if dwz(1) does not create one (but
               succeeds anyway).  This commonly happens when the debug files
               do not contain debug symbols (e.g. a missing -g to the
               compiler) or when the debug symbols are compressed (see
               Debian bug #931891).  If --dwz-multifile is passed, then
               dh_dwz will abort with an error if dwz(1) does not create a
               multifile.
               Note this options may not work if a package contains more ELF
               binaries than can fit on a single command line.  If this
               becomes a problem, please pass --no-dwz-multifile to work
               around the issue.
               The generated multifile will be compressed with objcopy
               --compress-debug-sections.
               Note for udeb packages: dh_dwz will never generate multifiles
               for udeb packages.  It will still use dwz to reduce the file
               size of debug files if it finds any.
           -Xitem, --exclude=item
               Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename
               from being stripped. You may use this option multiple times
               to build up a list of things to exclude.
           -- params
               Pass params to dwz(1) when it processes ELF binaries.  This
               is mostly useful for setting memory related parameters (e.g.
               -l and -L).
## NOTES         top
           If the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable contains nostrip,
           nothing will be stripped, in accordance with Debian policy
           (section 10.1 "Binaries").
           While this tool technically does not remove debug information
           from binaries, it is still skipped when the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
           environment variable contains nostrip.  This is because nostrip
           is often used to optimize build times (e.g. for "build and
           test"-cycles) rather than optimizing for size.
