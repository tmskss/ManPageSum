    TIMEOUT(1)                    User Commands                   TIMEOUT(1)
## NAME         top
           timeout - run a command with a time limit
## SYNOPSIS         top
           timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]...
           timeout [OPTION]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           --preserve-status
                  exit with the same status as COMMAND, even when the
                  command times out
           --foreground
                  when not running timeout directly from a shell prompt,
                  allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and get TTY signals; in
                  this mode, children of COMMAND will not be timed out
           -k, --kill-after=DURATION
                  also send a KILL signal if COMMAND is still running
                  this long after the initial signal was sent
           -s, --signal=SIGNAL
                  specify the signal to be sent on timeout;
                  SIGNAL may be a name like 'HUP' or a number; see 'kill -l'
                  for a list of signals
           -v, --verbose
                  diagnose to stderr any signal sent upon timeout
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           DURATION is a floating point number with an optional suffix: 's'
           for seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd'
           for days.  A duration of 0 disables the associated timeout.
           Upon timeout, send the TERM signal to COMMAND, if no other SIGNAL
           specified.  The TERM signal kills any process that does not block
           or catch that signal.  It may be necessary to use the KILL
           signal, since this signal can't be caught.
       Exit status:
           124    if COMMAND times out, and --preserve-status is not
                  specified
           125    if the timeout command itself fails
           126    if COMMAND is found but cannot be invoked
           127    if COMMAND cannot be found
           137    if COMMAND (or timeout itself) is sent the KILL (9) signal
                  (128+9)
           -      the exit status of COMMAND otherwise
## BUGS         top
           Some platforms don't currently support timeouts beyond the year
           2038.
