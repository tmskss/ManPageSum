## NAME         top
           mkaf - create a Performance Co-Pilot archive folio
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/mkaf [-?]  [findopts] filename ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           A collection of one or more Performance Co-Pilot (see
           PCPIntro(1)) archive logs may be combined with mkaf to produce a
           PCP archive folio and the associated archive folio control file.
           Some PCP tools use mkaf to create archive folios, e.g. the
           ``record'' facility in the pmchart(1) and pmview(1) tools, to
           facilitate playback with pmafm(1).
           mkaf processes each filename argument, and if this is a component
           file from a PCP archive that archive is added to the folio.
           If filename is a directory, then this is searched recursively
           using find(1).  Any filename argument beginning with a ``-'' is
           assumed to be a find(1) command line option (findopts); the
           default is -follow if no findopts are specified.
           The first named archive in the folio is assumed to be associated
           with the default host for any tool that tries to replay multiple
           archives from the folio.
           The folio control file is written to standard output, and has the
           following format.
           1. The first line contains the word PCPFolio.
           2. The second line contains the tag Version: followed by the
              format version number (currently 1).
           3. For subsequent lines, blank lines and lines beginning with
              ``#'' are ignored.
           4. The line beginning with the tag Created: documents where and
              when the folio was created.
           5. The line beginning with the tag Creator: identifies the tool
              which created the folio (and is assumed to know how to replay
              the archive folio).  If present, the second argument is the
              name of a configuration file that the creator tool could use
              to replay the archive folio, e.g. with the replay command for
              pmafm(1).  In the case of mkaf (unlike pmchart(1) or
              pmview(1)) there is no knowledge of the contents of the
              archives, so the ``creator'' cannot replay the archive,
              however pmchart(1) is able to replay any archive, and so this
              tool is identified as the Creator: for archive folios created
              by mkaf(1).
           6. This is then followed by one or more lines beginning with the
              tag Archive: followed by the hostname and base name of the
              archive.
           For example
                $ mkaf mydir/gonzo
           might produce the following folio control file.
           PCPFolio
           Version: 1
           # use pmafm(1) to process this PCP archive folio
           #
           Created: on gonzo at Tue Jul  2 03:35:54 EST 1996
           Creator: pmchart
           #               Host                    Basename
           #
           Archive:        gonzo                   mydir/gonzo/960627
           Archive:        gonzo                   mydir/gonzo/960628
           Archive:        gonzo                   mydir/gonzo/960629
           Archive:        gonzo                   mydir/gonzo/960630
           Archive:        gonzo                   mydir/gonzo/960701
           Archive:        gonzo                   mydir/gonzo/960701.00.10
           Archive:        gonzo                   mydir/gonzo/960701.05.25
           Archive:        gonzo                   mydir/gonzo/960702.00.10
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -?   Display usage message and exit.
           -findopts
                Options to be passed to find(1).  The default is -follow.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           Some informational messages, warnings and pathological conditions
           are reported on standard error.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
           find(1), PCPIntro(1), pmafm(1), pmchart(1), pmview(1),
           pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).
