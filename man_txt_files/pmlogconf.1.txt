## NAME         top
           pmlogconf - create/edit a pmlogger configuration file
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmlogconf [-cqrvV?]  [-d groupsdir] [-g grouptag] [-h host] [-s
           groupfile] configfile
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmlogconf may be used to create and modify a generic
           configuration file for the PCP archive logger, pmlogger(1).
           If configfile does not exist, pmlogconf will create a generic
           configuration file with a default set of enabled metrics and
           logging intervals.
           Once created, configfile may be used with the -c option to
           pmlogger(1) to select performance metrics and specify logging
           intervals for a PCP archive.
           If configfile does exist, pmlogconf will prompt for input from
           the user to enable or disable groups of related performance
           metrics and to control the logging interval for each enabled
           group.
           Group selection requires a simple y (yes) or n (no) response to
           the prompt Log this group?.
           Other responses at this point may be used to select additional
           control functions as follows:
           m         Report the names of the metrics in the current group.
           q         Finish with group selection (quit) and make no further
                     changes to this group or any subsequent group.
           /pattern  Make no change to this group but search for a group
                     containing pattern in the description of the group or
                     the names of the associated metrics.
           A logging interval is specified by responding to the Logging
           interval?  prompt with the keywords once or default or a valid
           pmlogger(1) interval specification of the form ``every N
           timeunits'' or simply ``N timeunits '' (the every is optional)
           where N is an unsigned integer and timeunits is one of the
           keywords msec, millisecond, sec, second, min, minute, hour or the
           plural form of one of the keywords.
           When run from automated logging setup processes, the -c option is
           used to indicate that pmlogconf is in auto-create mode and no
           interactive dialog takes place.  The output configfile has an
           additional comment message and timestamp indicating this fact, so
           that it can be identified and subsequently updated using -c
           again.  This option is not appropriate for interactive use of the
           tool.
           The -q option suppresses the logging interval dialog and
           preserves the current interval from configfile.
           More verbose output may be enabled with the -v option.
## SETUP GROUP FILES         top
           When an initial configfile is created, the default specifications
           come from a set of group files below the groupsdir specified with
           the -d option (the default groupsdir is
           $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf which is most commonly correct, so
           the -d option is rarely used in practice).
           The directory structure below groupsdir is arbitrary as all
           regular files will be found by recursive descent and considered,
           so add-on products and PMDA developers can easily extend the
           available defaults to pmlogconf by adding new directories and/or
           group files below groupsdir.
           These group files are processed in the following ways:
           •  When a new configfile is created, all group files are
              processed.
           •  Whenever pmlogconf is run with an existing configfile,
              groupsdir is traversed to see if any new groups have been
              defined and should be considered for inclusion in configfile.
           •  When pmlogconf processes a group in configfile that is
              enabled, the list of metrics associated with the group is
              taken from the group file (and replaces any previous list of
              metrics associated with this group in configfile).
           •  When either the -r (reprobe) or the -c (auto-create) command
              line option is specified, every group (not just newly
              discovered ones) is reprocessed to see if it should be
              considered for inclusion in configfile.
           •  If a group is found in configfile but the corresponding group
              does not exist below groupsdir (as would be the case when a
              group is made obsolete by a PCP upgrade) then the handling of
              the group depends on the mode in which pmlogconf is being run.
              With -c the corresponding group is culled from configfile,
              otherwise the corresponding group is unchanged in configfile.
              In either case a warning is issued.
           Each group file is structured as follows:
           •  The first line must contain #pmlogconf-setup 2.0
           •  Other lines beginning with # are treated as comments.
           •  Blank lines are ignored.
           •  One or more lines starting with the keyword ident are used to
              provide the human-readable description of the group.
           •  Non-blank lines beginning with white space define metrics to
              be associated with this group, one per line.  Each metric
              specification follows the rules for a pmlogger(1)
              configuration, namely either the name of a non-leaf node in
              the PMNS (implying all descendent names in the PMNS), or the
              name of a leaf node in the PMNS optionally followed by one or
              more instance names enclosed by ``['' and ``]''.
           •  A control line starting with one of the keywords probe or
              force must be present.
           •  An optional logging interval control line begins with the
              keyword delta followed by one of the pmlogger(1) interval
              specification described above.
           •  probe control lines have the format:
                          probe metric [condition [state_rule] ]
              where metric is the name of a PCP metric (must be a leaf node
              in the PMNS, no instance specification is allowed, and it must
              not be a derived metric) and the optional condition is the
              keyword exists (true if metric exists, i.e. is defined in the
              PMNS) or the keyword values (true if metric exists in the PMNS
              and has one or more current values) or an expression of the
              form
                                          op val
              where op is one of the awk(1) operators (==, !=, >, >=, <, <=,
              ~ (regular expression match) or !~ (negated regular expression
              match)) and val is a value (arbitrary sequence of characters,
              excluding a space) and the condition is true if there is some
              instance of metric that makes the expression true.
              If the condition is missing, the default is exists.
              When an explicit condition is provided, there may also be an
              optional state_rule of the form
                                ? true_state : false_state
              where true_state (applies if condition is true) and
              false_state (applies if condition is false) are both taken
              from the keywords include (include and enable the group and
              the associated metrics in configfile), available (include and
              disable the group in configfile - a user action of y as
              described above is needed to enable the group and add the
              associated metrics into configfile) or exclude (the group is
              not considered for inclusion in configfile).
              The default state_rule is
                                  ? available : exclude
           •  force control lines begin with the keyword force followed by
              one of the states defined above, so one of the actions
              include, exclude or available is applied unconditionally to
              the group.
           Probing is only done when a new group is being added to
           configfile or when the -r command line option is specified.  The
           evaluation of the probing conditions is done by contacting
           pmcd(1) on hostname (defaults to local:).
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -c   Enable non-interactive, auto-create mode.
           -d groupdir, --groups=groupdir
                Specify the path to the groupsdir directory.
           -g grouptag, --group=grouptag
                Query logging state for the specific logging group named
                grouptag.
           -h host, --host=host
                Performance metrics source is pmcd(1) on host, rather than
                on the default localhost.
           -q, --quiet
                Quiet mode, suppress logging interval dialog.
           -r, --reprobe
                Reconsider every group for inclusion in the configfile.
           -s groupfile, --setup=groupfile
                Report the default logging state for the one logging group
                in groupfile.  This is equivalent output to that produced by
                the retired pmlogconf-setup shell script from earlier
                versions of PCP.
           -v, --verbose
                Enable verbose mode.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## EXAMPLE         top
           The following group file demonstrates all of the supported
           syntactic elements.
           #pmlogconf-setup 2.0
           ident   Example group file
           ident   ... more description
           delta   1 minute
           probe   sample.secret.foo.one values ? include : exclude
                   sample.secret.foo.one
                   sample.secret.foo.bar   # non-leaf in the PMNS
                   sample.colour [ red green ]
## MIGRATION         top
           The current version of pmlogconf (2.0) supports a slightly
           different format for configfile compared to earlier versions.  If
           an old version configfile is presented to pmlogconf it will be
           converted to the new format.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           pmlogconf overrides any $PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment variable
           to an empty string, for performance reasons.
           pmlogconf honours the $PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT environment variable
           when probing and creating new pmlogger configuration files.  It
           uses a default timeout value of 10 seconds for this, in the
           absence of an environment setting.
