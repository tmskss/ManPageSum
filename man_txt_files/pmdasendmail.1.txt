## NAME         top
           pmdasendmail - sendmail performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/pmdasendmail [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-U
           username]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdasendmail is a sendmail Performance Metrics Domain Agent
           (PMDA) which exports mail traffic statistics as collected by
           sendmail(1).
           Before the sendmail PMDA can export any metrics, sendmail(1) must
           have statistics collection enabled.  This involves checking the
           name of the statistics file, as given by the OS or O StatusFile
           control lines in /etc/sendmail.cf, and then creating this file if
           it does not already exist.  Removing the file will terminate
           statistics collection by sendmail(1) and hence the sendmail PMDA.
           A brief description of the pmdasendmail command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                sendmail.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdasendmail is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If
                the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
           There are no communication options, as the Install script ensures
           the sendmail PMDA will be connected to PMCD by a pipe.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           sendmail performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail
                # ./Remove
           pmdasendmail is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

                  sendmail configuration file to identify the name of the
                  statistics file
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
