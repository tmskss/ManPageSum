## NAME         top
           kbdinfo - read information about keyboard state
## SYNOPSIS         top
           kbdinfo [options] getmode [text|graphics]
           kbdinfo [options] gkbmode [raw|xlate|mediumraw|unicode]
           kbdinfo [options] gkbmeta [metabit|escprefix]
           kbdinfo [options] gkbled  [scrolllock|numlock|capslock]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The utility allows you to read and check various parameters of
           the keyboard and virtual console.
           getmode  Get or check virtual console mode.
           gkbmode  Gets current keyboard mode.
                  raw    Raw (scancode) mode. These are the raw codes
                         generated by the keyboard.
                  mediumraw
                         Medium raw (scancode) mode. This is extended medium
                         raw mode, with keys above 127 encoded as 0, high 7
                         bits, low 7 bits, with the 0 bearing the 'up' flag
                         if needed. 0 is reserved, so this shouldn't
                         interfere with anything else. The two bytes after 0
                         will always have the up flag set not to interfere
                         with older applications. This allows for 16384
                         different keycodes, which should be enough.
                  xlate  Translate keycodes using keymap. These are the
                         codes generated via the current keysym mapping.
                  unicode
                         Unicode mode.
           gkbmeta  Gets meta key handling mode.
                  escprefix
                         Specifies if pressing the meta (alt) key generates
                         an ESC (\033) prefix followed by the keysym.
                  metabit
                         The keysym marked with the high bit set.
           gkbled   Get keyboard flags CapsLock, NumLock, ScrollLock (not
                    lights).
                  scrolllock
                         The scroll lock is down.
                  numlock
                         The num lock is down.
                  capslock
                         The caps lock is down.
## OPTIONS         top
           -C, --console=DEV
                  the console device to be used;
           -V, --version
                  print version number;
           -h, --help
                  print this usage message.
