## NAME         top
           pcp-atopsar - Advanced System Activity Report (pcp-atop related)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] atopsar [atop options] [-r file|date] [-h host]
           [-R cnt] [-b yy-mm-dd] hh:mm] [-e yy-mm-dd] hh:mm]
           pcp [pcp options] atopsar [atop options] interval [samples]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The pcp-atopsar program can be used to report statistics at the
           system level.
           In the first synopsis line (no sampling interval specified), pcp-
           atopsar extracts data from a raw logfile that has been recorded
           previously by pmlogger(1) (or via the -w option of the pcp-atop
           program).
           You can specify the name of the logfile with the -r option of the
           pcp-atopsar program.  When a pmlogger daily logfile is used,
           named $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/[host]/YYYYMMDD (where YYYYMMDD
           reflects the date), the required date of the form YYYYMMDD can be
           specified with the -r option instead of the filename, or the
           symbolic name 'y' can be used for yesterday's daily logfile (this
           can be repeated so 'yyyy' indicates the logfile of four days
           ago).  If the -r option is not specified at all, today's daily
           logfile is used by default.
           By default, the hostname of the localhost will be used when
           resolving pmlogger archives, however an alternative host can be
           specified using the -h option.
           The starting and ending times of the report can be defined using
           the options -b and -e followed by a time argument of the form
           [yy-mm-dd] hh:mm.
           In the second synopsis line, pcp-atopsar reads actual activity
           counters from the kernel with the specified interval (in seconds)
           and the specified number of samples (optionally).  When pcp-
           atopsar is activated in this way it immediately sends the output
           for every requested report to standard output.  If only one type
           of report is requested, the header is printed once and after
           every interval seconds the statistical counters are shown for
           that period.  If several reports are requested, a header is
           printed per sample followed by the statistical counters for that
           period.
           When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the PCPIntro(1) options
           -h/--host, -a/--archive, -O/--origin, -s/--samples,
           -t/--interval, -Z/--timezone and several other pcp options become
           indirectly available, see PCPIntro(1) for their descriptions.
           Some generic flags can be specified to influence the behaviour of
           the pcp-atopsar program:
           -S   By default the timestamp at the beginning of a line is
                suppressed if more lines are shown for one interval. With
                this flag a timestamp is given for every output-line (easier
                for post-processing).
           -a   By default certain resources as disks and network interfaces
                are only shown when they were active during the interval.
                With this flag all resources of a given type are shown, even
                if they were inactive during the interval.
           -x   By default pcp-atopsar only uses colors if output is
                directed to a terminal (window).  These colors might
                indicate that a critical occupation percentage has been
                reached (red) or has been almost reached (cyan) for a
                particular resource.  See the man-page of atop for a
                detailed description of this feature (section COLORS).
                With the flag -x the use of colors is suppressed
                unconditionally.
           -C   By default pcp-atopsar only uses colors if output is
                directed to a terminal (window).  These colors might
                indicate that a critical occupation percentage has been
                reached (red) or has been almost reached (cyan) for a
                particular resource.  See the man-page of atop for a
                detailed description of this feature (section COLORS).
                With the flag -C colors will always be used, even if output
                is not directed to a terminal.
           -M   Use markers at the end of a line to indicate that a critical
                occupation percentage has been reached ('*') or has been
                almost reached ('+') for particular resources. The marker
                '*' is similar to the color red and the marker '+' to the
                color cyan. See the man-page of atop for a detailed
                description of these colors (section COLORS).
           -H   Repeat the header line within a report for every N detail
                lines. The value of N is determined dynamically in case of
                output to a tty/window (depending on the number of lines);
                for output to a file or pipe this value is 23.
           -R   Summarize cnt samples into one sample. When the logfile
                contains e.g. samples of 10 minutes, the use of the flag '-R
                6' shows a report with one sample for every hour.
           Other flags are used to define which reports are required:
           -A   Show all possible reports.
           -c   Report about CPU utilization (in total and per cpu).
           -g   Report about GPU utilization (per GPU).
           -p   Report about processor-related matters, like load-averages
                and hardware interrupts.
           -P   Report about processes.
           -m   Current memory- and swap-occupation.
           -s   Report about paging- and swapping-activity, and
                overcommitment.
           -B   Report about Pressure Stall Information (PSI).
           -l   Report about utilization of logical volumes.

## PCP ATOPSAR OPTIONS         top
           The following additional PCP command line long options are also
           available:
           --align=align
                Force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a
                natural time unit align.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
                complete description of the syntax for align.
           --archive=archive
                Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
                Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log files identified by
                the argument archive, which is a comma-separated list of
                names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
                the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
           --finish=endtime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged before or at endtime.
                Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
                syntax for endtime.
           --host=host
                Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather than
                from the default localhost.
           --hostzone
                Use the local timezone of the host that is the source of the
                performance metrics, as identified by either the --host or
                the --archive options.  The default is to use the timezone
                of the local host.
           --hotproc
                Use the pmdaproc(1) hotproc metrics.
           --interval=interval
                Set the reporting interval to something other than the
                default 1 second.  The interval argument follows the syntax
                described in PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest form may be an
                unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are
                seconds).
           --samples=samples
                The samples option defines the number of samples to be
                retrieved and reported.
           --start=starttime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged at or after starttime.
                Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
                syntax for starttime.
           --timezone=timezone
                Use timezone for the date and time.  Timezone is in the
                format of the environment variable TZ as described in
                environ(7).
           --version
                Display version number and exit.
## OUTPUT DESCRIPTION         top
           Depending on the requested report, a number of columns with
           output values are produced.  The values are mostly presented as a
           number of events per second.
           The output for the flag -c contains the following columns per
           cpu:
           usr%   Percentage of cpu-time consumed in user mode (program
                  text) for all active processes running with a nice value
                  of zero (default) or a negative nice value (which means a
                  higher priority than usual).  The cpu consumption in user
                  mode of processes with a nice value larger than zero
                  (lower priority) is indicated in the nice%-column.
           nice%  Percentage of cpu time consumed in user mode (i.e. program
                  text) for all processes running witn a nice value larger
                  than zero (which means with a lower priority than
                  average).
           sys%   Percentage of cpu time consumed in system mode (kernel
                  text) for all active processes. A high percentage usually
                  indicates a lot of system calls being issued.
           irq%   Percentage of cpu time consumed for handling of device
                  interrupts.
           softirq%
                  Percentage of cpu time consumed for soft interrupt
                  handling.
           steal% Percentage of cpu time stolen by other virtual machines
                  running on the same hardware.
           guest% Percentage of cpu time used by other virtual machines
                  running on the same hardware (overlaps with usr%/nice%).
           wait%  Percentage of unused cpu time while at least one of the
                  processes in wait-state awaits completion of disk I/O.
           idle%  Percentage of unused cpu time because all processes are in
                  a wait-state but not waiting for disk-I/O.
           The output for the flag -g contains the following columns per
           GPU:

                  GPU number and bus-ID (separated by '/').
           gpubusy
                  GPU busy percentage during interval.
           membusy
                  GPU memory busy percentage during interval, i.e. time to
                  issue read and write accesses on memory.
           memocc Percentage of memory occupation at this moment.
           memtot Total memory available.
           memuse Used GPU memory at this moment.
           gputype
                  Type of GPU.
           The output for the flag -p contains the following values:
           pswch/s
                  Number of process switches (also called context switches)
                  per second on this cpu. A process switch occurs at the
                  moment that an active thread (i.e.  the thread using a
                  cpu) enters a wait state or has used its time slice
                  completely; another thread will then be chosen to use the
                  cpu.
           devintr/s
                  Number of hardware interrupts handled per second on this
                  cpu.

           loadavg5
                  Load average reflecting the average number of threads in
                  the runqueue or in non-interruptible wait state (usually

           loadavg15
                  Load average reflecting the average number of threads in
                  the runqueue or in non-interruptible wait state (usually
                  waiting for disk or tape I/O) during the last 15 minutes.
           The output for the flag -P contains information about the
           processes and threads:

           thrslpi
                  Total number of threads present in the system in state
                  'interruptible sleeping'.
           thrslpu
                  Total number of threads present in the system in state
                  'uninterruptible sleeping'.
           The output for the flag -m contains information about the memory-
           and swap-utilization:
           memtotal
                  Total usable main memory size.
           memfree
                  Available main memory size at this moment (snapshot).
           buffers
                  Main memory used at this moment to cache metadata-blocks
                  (snapshot).

                  Total swap space size at this moment (snapshot).
           swpfree
                  Available swap space at this moment (snapshot).
           The output for the flag -s contains information about the
           frequency of swapping:
           pagescan/s
                  Number of scanned pages per second due to the fact that
                  free memory drops below a particular threshold.
           swapin/s
                  The number of memory-pages the system read from the swap-
                  device per second.

                  The number of processes being killed during the last
                  interval due to lack of memory/swap. The value -1 means
                  that this counter is not supported by the current kernel
                  version.
           commitspc
                  The committed virtual memory space i.e.  the reserved

                  for processes.
           commitlim
                  The maximum limit for the committed space, which is by
                  default swap size plus 50% of memory size.  The kernel
                  only verifies whether the committed space exceeds the
                  limit if strict overcommit handling is configured
                  (vm.overcommit_memory is 2).
           The output for the flag -B contains the Pressure Stall
           Information (PSI):
           cpusome
                  Average pressure percentage during the interval for the
                  category 'CPU some'.

                  category 'memory some'.
           memfull
                  Average pressure percentage during the interval for the
                  category 'memory full'.
           iosome Average pressure percentage during the interval for the
                  category 'I/O some'.
           iofull Average pressure percentage during the interval for the
                  category 'I/O full'.
           The output for the flags -l (LVM), -f (MD), and -d (hard disk)
           contains the following columns per active unit:
           disk   Name.

           The output for the flag -O provides information about the top-3
           of processes with the highest processor consumption:
           pid    Process-id (if zero, the process has exited while the pid
                  could not be determined).
           command
                  The name of the process.
           cpu%   The percentage of cpu-capacity being consumed.  This value

                  multiprocessor machine.
           The output for the flag -G provides information about the top-3
           of processes with the highest memory consumption:
           pid    Process-id (if zero, the process has exited while the pid
                  could not be determined).

           dsk%   The percentage of read and write accesses related to the
                  total number of read and write accesses issued on disk by
                  all processes, so a high percentage does not imply a high
                  disk load on system level.
           The output for the flag -N provides information about the top-3
           of processes that issue the most socket transfers for IPv4/IPv6:

           net%   The percentage of socket transfers related to the total
                  number of transfers issued by all processes, so a high
                  percentage does not imply a high network load on system
                  level.
## EXAMPLES         top
           To see today's cpu-activity so far (supposed that atop is logging
           in the background):
             pcp-atopsar
           To see the memory occupation for June 5, 2018 between 10:00 and
           12:30 (supposed that pmlogger has been logging daily in the
           background on host acme.com):
             pcp-atopsar -m -r $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/acme.com/20180605 -b
           10:00 -e 12:30
                  or
             pcp-atopsar -m -r 20180605 -b 10:00 -e 12:30
                  or, suppose it is June 8, 2018 at this moment
             pcp-atopsar -m -r yyy -b 10:00 -e 12:30
           Write a logfile with atop to record the system behaviour for 30
           minutes (30 samples of one minute) and produce all available
           reports afterwards:
             pcp-atop -w /tmp/atoplog 60 30
             pcp-atopsar -A -r /tmp/atoplog
           To watch TCP activity evolve for ten minutes (10 samples with
           sixty seconds interval):
             pcp-atopsar -t 60 10
           To watch the header-lines ('_' as last character) of all reports
           with only the detail-lines showing critical resource consumption
           (marker '*' or '+' as last character):
             pcp-atopsar -AM | grep '[_*+]$'
## FILES         top
           /etc/atoprc
                Configuration file containing system-wide default values

                date, and HOST is the hostname of the machine being logged.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
