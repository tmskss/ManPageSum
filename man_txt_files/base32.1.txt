## NAME         top
           base32 - base32 encode/decode data and print to standard output
## SYNOPSIS         top
           base32 [OPTION]... [FILE]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Base32 encode or decode FILE, or standard input, to standard
           output.
           With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -d, --decode
                  decode data
           -i, --ignore-garbage
                  when decoding, ignore non-alphabet characters
           -w, --wrap=COLS
                  wrap encoded lines after COLS character (default 76).  Use
                  0 to disable line wrapping
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           The data are encoded as described for the base32 alphabet in RFC
           4648.  When decoding, the input may contain newlines in addition
           to the bytes of the formal base32 alphabet.  Use --ignore-garbage
           to attempt to recover from any other non-alphabet bytes in the
           encoded stream.
