    RENICE(1P)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             RENICE(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           renice — set nice values of running processes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           renice [-g|-p|-u] -n increment ID...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The renice utility shall request that the nice values (see the
           Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 3.244, Nice
           Value) of one or more running processes be changed. By default,
           the applicable processes are specified by their process IDs. When
           a process group is specified (see -g), the request shall apply to
           all processes in the process group.
           The nice value shall be bounded in an implementation-defined
           manner.  If the requested increment would raise or lower the nice
           value of the executed utility beyond implementation-defined
           limits, then the limit whose value was exceeded shall be used.
           When a user is reniced, the request applies to all processes
           whose saved set-user-ID matches the user ID corresponding to the
           user.
           Regardless of which options are supplied or any other factor,
           renice shall not alter the nice values of any process unless the
           user requesting such a change has appropriate privileges to do so
           for the specified process. If the user lacks appropriate
           privileges to perform the requested action, the utility shall
           return an error status.
           The saved set-user-ID of the user's process shall be checked
           instead of its effective user ID when renice attempts to
           determine the user ID of the process in order to determine
           whether the user has appropriate privileges.
## OPTIONS         top
           The renice utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
           for Guideline 9.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -g        Interpret the following operands as unsigned decimal
                     integer process group IDs.
           -n increment
                     Specify how the nice value of the specified process or
                     processes is to be adjusted. The increment option-
                     argument is a positive or negative decimal integer that
                     shall be used to modify the nice value of the specified
                     process or processes.
                     Positive increment values shall cause a lower nice
                     value. Negative increment values may require
                     appropriate privileges and shall cause a higher nice
                     value.
           -p        Interpret the following operands as unsigned decimal
                     integer process IDs. The -p option is the default if no
                     options are specified.
           -u        Interpret the following operands as users. If a user
                     exists with a user name equal to the operand, then the
                     user ID of that user is used in further processing.
                     Otherwise, if the operand represents an unsigned
                     decimal integer, it shall be used as the numeric user
                     ID of the user.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           ID        A process ID, process group ID, or user name/user ID,
                     depending on the option selected.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           renice:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
            1. Adjust the nice value so that process IDs 987 and 32 would
               have a lower nice value:
                   renice -n 5 -p 987 32
            2. Adjust the nice value so that group IDs 324 and 76 would have
               a higher nice value, if the user has appropriate privileges
               to do so:
                   renice -n -4 -g 324 76
            3. Adjust the nice value so that numeric user ID 8 and user sas
               would have a lower nice value:
                   renice -n 4 -u 8 sas
           Useful nice value increments on historical systems include 19 or
           20 (the affected processes run only when nothing else in the
           system attempts to run) and any negative number (to make
           processes run faster).
## RATIONALE         top
           The gid, pid, and user specifications do not fit either the
           definition of operand or option-argument. However, for clarity,
           they have been included in the OPTIONS section, rather than the
           OPERANDS section.
           The definition of nice value is not intended to suggest that all
           processes in a system have priorities that are comparable.
           Scheduling policy extensions such as the realtime priorities in
           the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 make the notion of a
           single underlying priority for all scheduling policies
           problematic. Some implementations may implement the nice-related
           features to affect all processes on the system, others to affect
           just the general time-sharing activities implied by this volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, and others may have no effect at all. Because of
           the use of ``implementation-defined'' in nice and renice, a wide
           range of implementation strategies are possible.
           Originally, this utility was written in the historical manner,
           using the term ``nice value''. This was always a point of concern
           with users because it was never intuitively obvious what this
           meant. With a newer version of renice, which used the term
           ``system scheduling priority'', it was hoped that novice users
           could better understand what this utility was meant to do. Also,
           it would be easier to document what the utility was meant to do.
           Unfortunately, the addition of the POSIX realtime scheduling
           capabilities introduced the concepts of process and thread
           scheduling priorities that were totally unaffected by the
           nice/renice utilities or the nice()/setpriority() functions.
           Continuing to use the term ``system scheduling priority'' would
           have incorrectly suggested that these utilities and functions
           were indeed affecting these realtime priorities. It was decided
           to revert to the historical term ``nice value'' to reference this
           unrelated process attribute.
           Although this utility has use by system administrators (and in
           fact appears in the system administration portion of the BSD
           documentation), the standard developers considered that it was
           very useful for individual end users to control their own
           processes.
           Earlier versions of this standard allowed the following forms in
           the SYNOPSIS:
               renice nice_value[-p] pid...[-g gid...][-p pid...][-u user...]
               renice nice_value -g gid...[-g gid...]-p pid...][-u user...]
               renice nice_value -u user...[-g gid...]-p pid...][-u user...]
           These forms are no longer specified by POSIX.1‐2008 but may be
           present in some implementations.
