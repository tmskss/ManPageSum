## NAME         top
           dh_shlibdeps - calculate shared library dependencies
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_shlibdeps [debhelper options] [-Lpackage] [-ldirectory]
           [-Xitem] [-- params]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_shlibdeps is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           calculating shared library dependencies for packages.
           This program is merely a wrapper around dpkg-shlibdeps(1) that
           calls it once for each package listed in the control file,
           passing it a list of ELF executables and shared libraries it has
           found.
## OPTIONS         top
           -Xitem, --exclude=item
               Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename
               from being passed to dpkg-shlibdeps. This will make their
               dependencies be ignored.  This may be useful in some
               situations, but use it with caution. This option may be used
               more than once to exclude more than one thing.
           -- params
               Pass params to dpkg-shlibdeps(1).
           -uparams, --dpkg-shlibdeps-params=params
               This is another way to pass params to dpkg-shlibdeps(1).  It
               is deprecated; use -- instead.
           -ldirectory[:directory ...]
               With recent versions of dpkg-shlibdeps, this option is
               generally not needed.
               It tells dpkg-shlibdeps (via its -l parameter), to look for
               private package libraries in the specified directory (or
               directories -- separate with colons). With recent versions of
               dpkg-shlibdeps, this is mostly only useful for packages that
               build multiple flavors of the same library, or other
               situations where the library is installed into a directory
               not on the regular library search path.
           -Lpackage, --libpackage=package
               With recent versions of dpkg-shlibdeps, this option is
               generally not needed, unless your package builds multiple
               flavors of the same library or is relying on
               debian/shlibs.local for an internal library.
               It tells dpkg-shlibdeps (via its -S parameter) to look first
               in the package build directory for the specified package,
               when searching for libraries, symbol files, and shlibs files.
               If needed, this can be passed multiple times with different
               package names.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Suppose that your source package produces libfoo1, libfoo-dev,
           and libfoo-bin binary packages. libfoo-bin links against libfoo1,
           and should depend on it. In your rules file, first run
           dh_makeshlibs, then dh_shlibdeps:
                   dh_makeshlibs
                   dh_shlibdeps
           This will have the effect of generating automatically a shlibs
           file for libfoo1, and using that file and the libfoo1 library in
           the debian/libfoo1/usr/lib directory to calculate shared library
           dependency information.
           If a libbar1 package is also produced, that is an alternate build
           of libfoo, and is installed into /usr/lib/bar/, you can make
           libfoo-bin depend on libbar1 as follows:
                   dh_shlibdeps -Llibbar1 -l/usr/lib/bar
