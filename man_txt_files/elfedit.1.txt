## DESCRIPTION         top
           elfedit updates the ELF header and program property of ELF files
           which have the matching ELF machine and file types.  The options
           control how and which fields in the ELF header and program
           property should be updated.
           elffile... are the ELF files to be updated.  32-bit and 64-bit
           ELF files are supported, as are archives containing ELF files.
## OPTIONS         top
           The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives,
           are equivalent. At least one of the --output-mach, --output-type,
           --output-osabi, --output-abiversion, --enable-x86-feature and
           --disable-x86-feature options must be given.
           --input-mach=machine
               Set the matching input ELF machine type to machine.  If
               --input-mach isn't specified, it will match any ELF machine
               types.
               The supported ELF machine types are, i386, IAMCU, L1OM, K1OM
               and x86-64.
           --output-mach=machine
               Change the ELF machine type in the ELF header to machine.
               The supported ELF machine types are the same as --input-mach.
           --input-type=type
               Set the matching input ELF file type to type.  If
               --input-type isn't specified, it will match any ELF file
               types.
               The supported ELF file types are, rel, exec and dyn.
           --output-type=type
               Change the ELF file type in the ELF header to type.  The
               supported ELF types are the same as --input-type.
           --input-osabi=osabi
               Set the matching input ELF file OSABI to osabi.  If
               --input-osabi isn't specified, it will match any ELF OSABIs.
               The supported ELF OSABIs are, none, HPUX, NetBSD, GNU, Linux
               (alias for GNU), Solaris, AIX, Irix, FreeBSD, TRU64, Modesto,
               OpenBSD, OpenVMS, NSK, AROS and FenixOS.
           --output-osabi=osabi
               Change the ELF OSABI in the ELF header to osabi.  The
               supported ELF OSABI are the same as --input-osabi.
           --input-abiversion=version
               Set the matching input ELF file ABIVERSION to version.
               version must be between 0 and 255.  If --input-abiversion
               isn't specified, it will match any ELF ABIVERSIONs.
           --output-abiversion=version
               Change the ELF ABIVERSION in the ELF header to version.
               version must be between 0 and 255.
           --enable-x86-feature=feature
               Set the feature bit in program property in exec or dyn ELF
               files with machine types of i386 or x86-64.  The supported
               features are, ibt, shstk, lam_u48 and lam_u57.
           --disable-x86-feature=feature
               Clear the feature bit in program property in exec or dyn ELF
               files with machine types of i386 or x86-64.  The supported
               features are the same as --enable-x86-feature.
               Note: --enable-x86-feature and --disable-x86-feature are
               available only on hosts with mmap support.
           -v
           --version
               Display the version number of elfedit.
           -h
           --help
               Display the command-line options understood by elfedit.
           @file
               Read command-line options from file.  The options read are
               inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does
               not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
               literally, and not removed.
               Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
               character may be included in an option by surrounding the
               entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any
               character (including a backslash) may be included by
               prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The
               file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
               options will be processed recursively.
