## NAME         top
           flatpak-permission-remove - Remove permissions
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak permission-remove [OPTION...] TABLE ID [APP_ID]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Removes an entry for the object with id ID to the permission
           store table TABLE. The ID must be in a suitable format for the
           table. If APP_ID is specified, only the entry for that
           application is removed.
           The permission store is used by portals. Each portal generally
           has its own table in the permission store, and the format of the
           table entries is specific to each portal.

           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
