## NAME         top
           pmlogger_rewrite - helper script to rewrite Performance Co-Pilot
           archives

## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmlogger_rewrite is a helper script that is used by
           pmlogger_daily(1) when rewriting Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
           archives.  Rewriting is usually required to accommodate
           evolutionary changes in metadata so old archives can be updated
           and then merged with current archives.
           pmlogger_rewrite is a wrapper script for pmlogrewrite(1) that
           will potentially rewrite all of the archive logs matching the
           archive arguments.  Each archive argument may be a PCP archive
           file name, the basename for the files in a PCP archive, or a
           directory (in which case all subordinate PCP archives are found
           by recursive descent).
           pmlogrewrite is run with the -i option so rewriting is done ``in
           place''.  The -q option is also used, so if no rewriting is
           required then no changes are made to the archive files.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are passed through to pmlogrewrite: -c (or
           --config), -d (or --desperate), -s (or --scale), -v (or
           --verbose) and -w (or --warnings).  Refer to pmlogrewrite(1) for
           the meaning of these options.
           The remaining options are:
           -N, --showme
                Runs pmlogger_rewrite in a ``show me'' or ``dry run'' mode
                where the tasks that would be performed are reported, but no
                changes are made.  This is typically used for debugging in
                combination with one (verbose) or two (very verbose) -V
                options.
           -V, --verbose
                Increase script output verbosity.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
