## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmview is a generalized 3D performance metrics visualization tool
           for the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP(1)).
           pmview is the base utility behind performance metrics
           visualization tools such as dkvis(1), mpvis(1), osvis(1) and
           nfsvis(1), It is also used by a range of related tools that are
           specific to optional Performance Domain Agents (PMDA) and/or PCP
           add-on products.  pmview may also be used to construct customized
           3D performance displays.
           pmview displays performance metrics as colored blocks and
           cylinders arranged on monochrome base planes. Each object may
           represent a single performance metric, or a stack of several
           performance metrics.  Since the objects are modulated by the
           value of the metric they represent, only numerical metrics may be
           visualized.  Objects representing a single metric may be
           modulated in terms of height, color, or height and color.
           Objects in a stack may only be height modulated, but the stack
           can be normalized to the maximum height.  Labels may be added to
           the scene to help identify groups of metrics.
           A configuration file (as specified by the -c option, or read from
           standard input) is used to specify the position, color, maximum
           value and labels of metrics and metric instances in the scene.
           The maximum value acts as a normalization factor and is used to
           scale the object height and/or color in proportion to the metric
           values.  Metric values which exceed the associated maximum value
           are displayed as solid white objects.  If a metric is
           unavailable, the object will have minimum height and will be
           colored grey.
           Normally, the tool operates in ``live'' mode where performance
           metrics are fetched in real-time.  The user can view metrics from
           any host running pmcd(1).  pmview can also replay archives of
           performance metrics (see pmlogger(1)) and allow the user to
           interactively control the current replay time and rate using the
           VCR paradigm.  This is particularly useful for retrospective
           comparisons and for post-mortem analysis of performance problems
           where a remote system is not accessible or a performance analyst
           is not available on-site.
           All metrics in the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) with
           numeric value semantics from any number of hosts or archives may
           be visualized.  pmview examines the semantics of the metrics and
           where sensible, converts metric values to a rate before scaling.
## COMMAND LINE OPTIONS         top
           The -S, -T, -O and -A options may be used to define a time window
           to restrict the samples retrieved, set an initial origin within
           the time window, or specify a ``natural'' alignment of the sample
           times; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of these
           options.
           The other available options are:
           -a archive[,archive,...]]
                  Specify an archive from which metrics can be obtained for
                  a particular host.  archive is the basename of an archive,
                  or the name of a directory conytaining archives,
                  previously created by pmlogger(1).  Multiple sets of
                  archives (separated by commas or in different -a options)
                  from different hosts may be given, but an error will occur
                  if there is more than one set of archives from the same
                  host. Any metrics that are not associated with a specific
                  host or archive in the configuration file will use the
                  first set of archives as their source.
           -C     Parse the configuration file and exit before displaying
                  the pmview window.  Any errors in the configuration file
                  are displayed.
           -c configfile
                  Load the configuration from configfile rather than
                  standard input.
           -h host
                  Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather
                  than the default localhost.  Implies that pmview will run
                  in live mode, so no archives can be specified on the
                  command line or in the configuration file.  Only one -h
                  option may be given.
           -n pmnsfile
                  Normally pmview operates on the distributed Performance
                  Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is
                  specified an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the
                  file pmnsfile.
           -p port
                  Connect to the time controls (see pmtime(1)) on this port.
                  Used when a tool launches another tool so that they can
                  connect to the same time controls.
           -R logconfig
                  Use logconfig as the pmlogger(1) config when recording.
           -r addconfig
                  Append addconfig onto the pmlogger(1) config generated by
                  pmview when recording.
           -t interval
                  The update interval used to fetch metrics from the live or
                  archive sources.  The interval argument follows the syntax
                  described in PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest form may be
                  an unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are
                  seconds).  The default is 2.0 seconds.
           -x version
                  Use the specified version of the pmlaunch(5)
                  specification.  The versions currently supported are
                  ``1.0'' and the default version ``2.0''.
           -Z timezone
                  By default, pmview reports the time of day according to
                  the local timezone on the system where pmview is run.  The
                  -Z option changes the default timezone to timezone which
                  should be in the format of the environment variable TZ as
                  described in environ(7).
           -z     Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
                  host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
                  identified via either the -h option, or the first -a
                  option.
           -geometry geometry
           -display display
           -name name
           -title title
           -xrm "resourceName: value"
                  Most standard X(1) command line arguments may be used.
## WINDOW         top
           The pmview window is comprised of a menu bar, time and scale
           controls, metric and time values, and an ``examiner'' viewer (see
           ivview(1)), which displays the 3D scene.
## EXAMINER VIEWER         top
           The left, right and bottom edges of the examiner viewer contain a
           variety of thumb wheels and buttons that can be used to adjust
           the visualization of the 3D scene.  The Rotx and Roty thumb
           wheels allow the user to rotate the scene about the x and y axes,
           respectively.  The dolly thumb wheel moves the virtual camera
           closer and further from the scene allowing the user to examine
           specific parts in detail or view the entire scene.  On the right
           edge of the viewer are eight buttons which affect the way the
           user can interact with the scene.
           Pointer
               Changes the cursor to a pointer which allows blocks to be
               selected in the scene.  See the Metric Selection section
               below.
           Hand
               Changes the cursor to a hand which allows the scene to be
               rotated, translated and dollied using a combination of mouse
               buttons.  The left mouse button can be used to rotate the
               scene in the direction of the mouse.  Releasing the left
               mouse button before the mouse has stopped moving will cause
               the scene to continue to rotate, which can be stopped by
               pressing the left mouse button again.  The middle mouse
               button will ``pan'' the scene, and both mouse buttons act as
               a dolly for the virtual camera.
           Question Mark
               Displays the SGI Help information for the examiner viewer.
           Home
               Changes the scene back to its original position, unless the
               home position has been changed by the home pointer button.
           Home Pointer
               Changes the home position of the scene to be the scene
               currently in view.
           Eye Resizes the scene so that it completely fits into the 3D
               viewing area.
           Cross-hairs
               Moves the object under the cursor to the center of the
               viewing area, if the hand cursor has been selected.  Pressing
               the ``s'' key while the cursor is over an object has the same
               effect.
           Perspective Box
               Switches the display between perspective and orthogonal
               projections.
           Pressing the right mouse button within the scene window will
           bring up a menu of options which affect how the 3D scene is
           drawn.  The options include drawing the blocks as wire frames,
           and turning on stereo viewing.
## METRIC SELECTION         top
           When the pointer cursor is active, more information about the 3D
           scene can be obtained.  Text describing the metric represented by
           the block under the cursor will be displayed in the top text box
           of the pmview window.  The text contains the source and name of
           the metric, current value and units, and the percentage of the
           expected maximum (or normalization) value.  The text box is
           updated whenever the scene is updated with the latest metric
           values or when the cursor is moved over another block in the
           scene.  Moving the cursor over a base plane block, text or the
           surrounding space will clear the text box.
           Clicking the left mouse button on a block will bind the text box
           on that metric instance so that the metric can be monitored while
           performing other actions with the mouse.  The block will be
           highlighted with a red wire frame.  Clicking the left mouse
           button on text or the space surrounding the scene will unselect
           the object, causing the text box to revert to the original
           behavior of showing the metric underneath the cursor.
           Selecting a base plane instead of a modulated block will cause
           all the blocks on that base plane to be selected.  When more than
           one object is selected, the text box behaves as if nothing is
           selected, so the metric displayed is the metric currently under
           the cursor.  Multiple selections are also possible by pressing
           the SHIFT key while selecting an object with the left mouse
           button.
## MENUS         top
           There are four menus in pmview's user interface which allow
           scenes to be recorded, saved and printed (File), access to the
           time controls (Options), launching other tools (Launch) and
           online help (Help).
           File/Record
               When in ``live'' mode, this option will launch pmlogger(1)
               processes to record the current scene into an archive folio
               (see pmafm(1)) so that it may be replayed at a later time.
               This option is not available in ``replay'' mode.
               When File/Record is selected, a file chooser dialog will
               prompt for the name of the new archive folio.  If the
               directory to the folio does not exist, pmview will attempt to
               create it.  It is usually convenient to keep each folio
               within its own directory as there will be several other files
               associated with the folio, including the generated archives.
               Once a valid folio has been created, pmview will launch a
               pmlogger(1) process for each host to collect the metrics
               required from that host in the current scene.  The current
               selections do not affect the set of metrics that are
               recorded.
               While recording is in progress, a red dot will appear in the
               time controls button in the top left-hand corner of the
               pmview window.  The File/Record option will also change to
               File/Stop Recording as only one recording session is possible
               at any one time.  Selecting blocks or launching other tools
               will have no affect on the recording session.
               The record session may be terminated by selecting File/Stop
               Recording.  This will display dialogs for each pmlogger(1)
               instance describing the size and location of the archive
               files before terminating each process.  When all pmlogger(1)
               processes have been terminated, the red dot is removed from
               the time controls button, and the menu reverts back to
               File/Record to allow another recording session to take place.
               If the application exists while recording, a dialog will
               appear allowing you to terminate each pmlogger(1) process, or
               leave it running unattached.
               An archive folio may be replayed using the command: ``pmafm
               folio replay''.  See pmafm(1) for more details.
               It is not uncommon for a front-end script which generates a
               pmview scene to use metrics that are not contained in the
               scene.  For example, osvis(1) uses several hinv metrics to
               determine the size and layout of some objects.  As these
               metrics are also needed when replaying the generated archive
               with the front-end script, a complete pmlogger(1) config can
               be specified (-R) that overrides the pmview generated config,
               or an additional config can be appended (-r) to the pmview
               generated config.
           File/Save
               Saves the current scene to a human-readable Open Inventor
               file (see inventor(1)).  A file dialog will prompt for the
               location of the file.  The default file extension is ``.iv''
               which is recognized by ivview(1) and some Web browsers.
           File/Print
               Outputs the current scene to a printer.  A print dialog will
               be displayed allowing a specific printer to be selected.
           File/Quit
               pmview immediately exits.  If recording was active, dialogs
               will be displayed for each pmlogger(1) process so that they
               may be terminated.
           Options/Show Time Control
               Displays the time controls (see pmtime(1)) that are driving
               this instance of pmview.  The time controls may be shared by
               other tools, including pmchart(1), that have been launched by
               other instances of pmview and oview(1).  Therefore, this menu
               item may appear to have no affect if the time controls are
               already visible.
           Options/New Time Control
               Disconnect with the current time controls (which may be
               shared by other tools, see pmtime(1)) and use a new time
               control that is not connected to any other tools.  The new
               time control will be immediately displayed.
           Launch
               The launch menu is generated from a menu specification file
               (see pmlaunch(5)).  The menu contains tools that may be
               launched based on the sources and names of the selected
               metrics in the scene.  For example, if the selected metrics
               are from three different hosts, then three copies of a tool
               may be launched, one for each host.  The behavior of a launch
               depends on the selected metrics and the tools being launched.
               On selection of a Launch menu item pmview generates state
               information in the pmlaunch(5) metrics specification format.
               This provides a description of the selected metrics (or if
               there are no selections, all the metrics) in the scene
               without any geometry information.
               Tools which can monitor multiple hosts and user specified
               metrics may be launched only once for those metrics (eg
               pmdumptext(1)).  Other tools which have a fixed view for one
               host (eg mpvis(1)), may be launched multiple times, once for
               each host in the selected metric list.  If the launched tools
               have time controls, they will share the time controls with
               the launching pmview.
               The set of launched tools is configurable, and may include
               IRIX and user applications.  See pmlaunch(5) for more
               details.
           Help/...
               If pcp.books.help has been installed, then the insight(1)
               books for pmview are displayed.
## TIME CONTROLS         top
           In addition to the menu options for time controls, the current
           direction of the time controls (see pmtime(1)) is shown in a
           button in the top-left corner of the pmview window.  Pressing
           this button will display the time control and is identical in
           behavior to Options/Show Time Control.
## SCALE CONTROLS         top
           Above the examiner window is a thumb wheel and an editable text
           box which allow the user to apply a multiplier to all values
           represented in the scene.  Spinning the wheel to the right and/or
           increasing the text value for the scale will increase the height
           of the bars.  Spinning the wheel to the left and/or lowering the
           text value will decrease the height of the bars.  The button to
           the right of the thumb wheel will reset the scale so that the
           bars appear at the original height for their current value.
## TIME INFORMATION         top
           Beside the scale controls is another text box which displays the
           time of the fetched metrics.  The time will change with the time
           controller (see pmtime(1)).
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           Are intended to be self-explanatory.  The environment variable
           PCP_STDERR can be set to force most startup warnings and errors
           to be sent to the standard error stream rather than posted in a
           dialog.

                Type1 fonts.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           The default face of the 3D font in the pmview window can be
           altered via PMVIEW_FONT environment variable which can be set to
           the base name of a Type1 font file in the default Inventor fonts
           directory.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
