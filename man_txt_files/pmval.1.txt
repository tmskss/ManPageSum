## NAME         top
           pmval, pmevent - arbitrary performance metrics value dumper
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmval [-dgLrvVXz?]  [-a archive] [-A align] [--container=name]
           [--derived=file] [-f N] [-h host] [-i instances] [-K spec] [-n
           pmnsfile] [-O offset] [-p port] [-s samples] [-S starttime] [-t
           interval] [-T endtime] [-U archive] [-w width] [-x pattern] [-Z
           timezone] metricname
           pmevent ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmval prints current or archived values for the nominated
           performance metric.  The metric of interest is named in the
           metricname argument, subject to instance qualification with the
           -i flag as described below.
           Unless directed to another host by the -h option, or to a set of
           archives by the -a or -U options, pmval will contact the
           Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host to
           obtain the required information.
           The metricname argument may also be given in the metric
           specification syntax, as described in PCPIntro(1), where the
           source, metric and instance may all be included in the
           metricname, e.g. thathost:kernel.all.load["1 minute"].  When this
           format is used, none of the -h or -a or -U options may be
           specified.
           When using the metric specification syntax, the ``hostname'' @ is
           treated specially and causes pmval to use a local context to
           collect metrics from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD.  Only
           some metrics are available in this mode.
           When processing a set of archives, pmval may relinquish its own
           timing control, and operate under the control of a a pmtime(1)
           process that uses a GUI dialog to provide timing control.  In
           this case, either the -g option should be used to start pmval as
           the sole client of a new pmtime(1) instance, or -p should be used
           to attach pmval to an existing pmtime(1) instance via the IPC
           channel identified by the port argument.
           The -S, -T, -O and -A options may be used to define a time window
           to restrict the samples retrieved, set an initial origin within
           the time window, or specify a ``natural'' alignment of the sample
           times; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of these
           options.
           The output from pmval is directed to standard output.  The
           following symbols may occasionally appear, in place of a metric
           value, in pmval output:  A question mark symbol (?) indicates
           that a value is no longer available for that metric instance.  An
           exclamation mark (!)  indicates that a 64-bit counter wrapped
           during the sample.
           pmevent is an alias for pmval.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a archive, --archive=archive
                Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
                Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log files identified by
                the archive argument, which is a comma-separated list of
                names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
                the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
                See also -U.
           -A align, --align=align
                Force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a
                natural time unit align.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
                complete description of the syntax for align.
           --container=container
                Specify an individual container to be queried.
           -d, --delay
                When replaying from an archive, this option requests that
                the prevailing real-time delay be applied between samples
                (see -t) to effect a pause, rather than the default
                behaviour of replaying at full speed.
           --derived=file
                Load derived metric definitions from file.
           -f precision, --precision=precision
                Numbers are reported in ``fixed point'' notation, rather
                than the default scientific notation, using precision digits
                for precision.  Each number will be up to the column width
                determined by the default heuristics, else the -w option if
                specified, and include precision digits after the decimal
                point.  So, the options -f 3 -w 8 would produce numbers of
                the form 9999.999.  A value of zero for precision omits the
                decimal point and any fractional digits.
           -g, --guimode
                Start pmval as the sole client of a new pmtime(1) server
                process for replay of archived performance data using the
                pmtime(1) graphical user interface.
           -h host, --host=host
                Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather than
                from the default localhost.
           -i instances, --instances=instances
                Specify a list of one or more names of instances for the
                nominated performance metric - just these instances will be
                retrieved and reported (the default is to report all
                instances).  The list must be a single argument, with
                elements of the list separated by commas and/or white space.
                The instance name may be quoted with single (') or double
                (") quotes for those cases where the instance name contains
                white space or commas.
                Multiple -i options are allowed as an alternative way of
                specifying more than one instance of interest.
                As an example, the following are all equivalent:
                     $ pmval -i "'1 minute','5 minute'" kernel.all.load
                     $ pmval -i '"1 minute","5 minute"' kernel.all.load
                     $ pmval -i "'1 minute' '5 minute'" kernel.all.load
                     $ pmval -i "'1 minute'" -i "'5 minute'" kernel.all.load
                     $ pmval 'localhost:kernel.all.load["1 minute","5 minute"]'
           -K spec, --spec-local=spec
                When fetching metrics from a local context (see -L), the -K
                option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
                made accessible.  The spec argument conforms to the syntax
                described in pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).  More than one -K option
                may be used.
           -L, --local-PMDA
                Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the
                local host without PMCD.  See also -K.
           -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
                Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5))
                from the file pmnsfile.
           -O origin, --origin=origin
                When reporting archived metrics, start reporting at origin
                within the time window (see -S and -T).  Refer to
                PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the syntax for
                origin.
           -p port, --guiport=port
                Attach pmval to an existing pmtime(1) time control process
                instance via the IPC channel identified by the port
                argument.  This option is normally only used by other tools,
                e.g.  pmchart(1), when they launch pmval with synchronized
                time control.
           -r, --raw
                Print raw values for cumulative counter metrics.  Normally
                cumulative counter metrics are converted to rates.  For
                example, disk transfers are reported as number of disk
                transfers per second during the preceding sample interval,
                rather than the raw value of number of disk transfers since
                the machine was booted.  If you specify this option, the raw
                metric values are printed.
           -s samples, --samples=samples
                The samples argument defines the number of samples to be
                retrieved and reported.  If samples is 0 or -s is not
                specified, pmval will sample and report continuously (in
                real time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives
                (in archive mode).
           -S starttime, --start=starttime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged at or after starttime.
                Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
                syntax for starttime.
           -t interval, --interval=interval
                Set the reporting interval to something other than the
                default 1 second.  The interval argument follows the syntax
                described in PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest form may be an
                unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are
                seconds).
           -T endtime, --finish=endtime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged before or at endtime.
                Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
                syntax for endtime.
           -U archive, --nointerp=archive
                Performance metric values are retrieved from the Performance
                Co-Pilot (PCP) archive.  The argument is a comma-separated
                list of names, each of which may be the base name of an
                archive or the name of a directory containing one or more
                archives.  However, unlike -a every recorded value in the
                archive for the selected metric and instances is reported
                (so no interpolation mode, and the sample interval (-t
                option) is ignored.  See also -a.
                At most one of the options -a and -U may be specified.
           -v, --verbose
                Enable verbose mode.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -w width, --width=width
                Set the width of each column of output to be width columns.
                If not specified columns are wide enough to accommodate the
                largest value of the type being printed.
           -x pattern, --filter=pattern
                The given pattern is sent to the performance metric domain
                agent for the requested metricname before any values are
                requested.  This serves two purposes.  Firstly, it provides
                a mechanism for server-side event filtering that is
                customisable for individual event streams.  In addition,
                some performance metrics domain agents also use the PMCD
                store mechanism to provide a basic security model (e.g. for
                sensitive log files, only a client host with pmStore(3)
                access would be able to access the event stream).
                As pattern may be processed by regcomp(3) it should be a
                non-empty string.  Use . (dot) for a “match all” pattern.
           -X, --timestamp
                When replaying from an archive, this option requests that
                the timestamp be reported with additional date information
                and increased precision (microseconds with a single -X,
                nanoseconds with an additional -X), for example
                Sat May 22 20:32:20.971633 2021 instead of the default
                format, for example 20:32:20.971.
           -z, --hostzone
                Use the local timezone of the host that is the source of the
                performance metrics, as identified by either the -h or the
                -a or the -U options.  The default is to use the timezone of
                the local host.
           -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
                Use timezone for the date and time.  Timezone is in the
                format of the environment variable TZ as described in
                environ(7).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## CAVEATS         top
           By default, pmval attempts to display non-integer numeric values
           in a way that does not distort the inherent precision (rarely
           more than 4 significant digits), and tries to maintain a tabular
           format in the output.  These goals are sometimes in conflict.
           In the absence of the -f option (described above), the following
           table describes the formats used for different ranges of numeric
           values for any metric that is of type PM_TYPE_FLOAT or
           PM_TYPE_DOUBLE, or any metric that has the semantics of a counter
           (for which pmval reports the rate converted value):

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
