## NAME         top
           pmsocks - shell wrapper for performance monitoring across
           firewalls
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmsocks path [args ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmsocks allows Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) clients running on
           hosts located on the internal side of a TCP/IP firewall to
           monitor remote hosts on the other side of the firewall.  This
           assumes the firewall has been configured with a compliant sockd
           daemon and the necessary access controls are satisfied.
           pmsocks is a thin shell wrapper around the tsocks(8) library
           using the tsocks(1) utility, which are not included with PCP.
           You can obtain tsocks from https://tsocks.sourceforge.net/ .
