## DESCRIPTION         top
           ldapmodify is a shell-accessible interface to the
           ldap_add_ext(3), ldap_modify_ext(3), ldap_delete_ext(3) and
           ldap_rename(3).  library calls.  ldapadd is implemented as a hard
           link to the ldapmodify tool.  When invoked as ldapadd the -a (add
           new entry) flag is turned on automatically.
           ldapmodify opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and
           modifies or adds entries.  The entry information is read from
           standard input or from file through the use of the -f option.
## OPTIONS         top
           -V[V]  Print version info.  If -VV is given, only the version
                  information is printed.
           -d debuglevel
                  Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapmodify
                  must be compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option
                  to have any effect.
           -n     Show what would be done, but don't actually modify
                  entries.  Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.
           -v     Use verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to
                  standard output.
           -a     Add new entries.  The default for ldapmodify is to modify
                  existing entries.  If invoked as ldapadd, this flag is
                  always set.
           -c     Continuous operation mode.  Errors are reported, but
                  ldapmodify will continue with modifications.  The default
                  is to exit after reporting an error.
           -f file
                  Read the entry modification information from file instead
                  of from standard input.
           -i time
                  Wait time microseconds before issuing an operation.
           -S file
                  Add or change records which were skipped due to an error
                  are written to file and the error message returned by the
                  server is added as a comment. Most useful in conjunction
                  with -c.
           -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.
           -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.
           -D binddn
                  Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP
                  directory.  For SASL binds, the server is expected to
                  ignore this value.
           -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of
                  specifying the password on the command line.
           -w passwd
                  Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.
           -y passwdfile
                  Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for
                  simple authentication.
           -H ldapuri
                  Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the
                  protocol/host/port fields are allowed; a list of URI,
                  separated by whitespace or commas is expected.
           -P {2|3}
                  Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.
           -e [!]ext[=extparam]
           -E [!]ext[=extparam]
                  Specify general extensions with -e and modify extensions
                  with -E.  ´!´ indicates criticality.
                  General extensions:
                    [!]assert=<filter>    (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                    !authzid=<authzid>    ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                    [!]bauthzid           (RFC 3829 authzid control)
                    [!]chaining[=<resolve>[/<cont>]]
                    [!]manageDSAit
                    [!]noop
                    ppolicy
                    [!]postread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                    [!]preread[=<attrs>]  (a comma-separated attribute list)
                    [!]relax
                    sessiontracking[=<username>]
                    abandon,cancel,ignore (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel,
                    or ignores response; if critical, doesn't wait for SIGINT.
                    not really controls)
                  Modify extensions:
                    [!]txn[=abort|commit]
           -o opt[=optparam]]
                  Specify any ldap.conf(5) option or one of the following:
                    nettimeout=<timeout>  (in seconds, or "none" or "max")
                    ldif_wrap=<width>     (in columns, or "no" for no wrapping)
           -O security-properties
                  Specify SASL security properties.
           -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is
                  to prompt only as needed.
           -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.
           -N     Do not use reverse DNS to canonicalize SASL host name.
           -U authcid
                  Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
                  the ID depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.
           -R realm
                  Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The
                  form of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism
                  used.
           -X authzid
                  Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.
                  authzid must be one of the following formats:
                  dn:<distinguished name> or u:<username>
           -Y mech
                  Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication.
                  If it's not specified, the program will choose the best
                  mechanism the server knows.
           -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended
                  operation. If you use -ZZ, the command will require the
                  operation to be successful.
## INPUT FORMAT         top
           The contents of file (or standard input if no -f flag is given on
           the command line) must conform to the format defined in ldif(5)
           (LDIF as defined in RFC 2849).
## EXAMPLES         top
           Assuming that the file /tmp/entrymods exists and has the
           contents:
               dn: cn=Modify Me,dc=example,dc=com
               changetype: modify
               replace: mail
               mail: modme@example.com
               -
               add: title
               title: Grand Poobah
               -
               add: jpegPhoto
               jpegPhoto:< file:///tmp/modme.jpeg
               -
               delete: description
               -
           the command:
               ldapmodify -f /tmp/entrymods
           will replace the contents of the "Modify Me" entry's mail
           attribute with the value "modme@example.com", add a title of
           "Grand Poobah", and the contents of the file "/tmp/modme.jpeg" as
           a jpegPhoto, and completely remove the description attribute.
           Assuming that the file /tmp/newentry exists and has the contents:
               dn: cn=Barbara Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
               objectClass: person
               cn: Barbara Jensen
               cn: Babs Jensen
               sn: Jensen
               title: the world's most famous mythical manager
               mail: bjensen@example.com
               uid: bjensen
           the command:
               ldapadd -f /tmp/newentry
           will add a new entry for Babs Jensen, using the values from the
           file /tmp/newentry.
           Assuming that the file /tmp/entrymods exists and has the
           contents:
               dn: cn=Barbara Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
               changetype: delete
           the command:
               ldapmodify -f /tmp/entrymods
           will remove Babs Jensen's entry.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-
           zero exit status and a diagnostic message being written to
           standard error.
