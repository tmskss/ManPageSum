## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-stop - stop the Ftrace Linux kernel tracer from writing
           to the ring buffer.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd stop [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) stop is a complement to trace-cmd-start(1). This
           will disable Ftrace from writing to the ring buffer. This does
           not stop the overhead that the tracing may incur. Only the
           updating of the ring buffer is disabled, the Ftrace tracing may
           still be inducing overhead.
           After stopping the trace, the trace-cmd-extract(1) may strip out
           the data from the ring buffer and create a trace.dat file. The
           Ftrace pseudo file system may also be examined.
           To disable the tracing completely to remove the overhead it
           causes, use trace-cmd-reset(1). But after a reset is performed,
           the data that has been recorded is lost.
## OPTIONS         top
           -B buffer-name
               If the kernel supports multiple buffers, this will stop the
               trace for only the given buffer. It does not affect any other
               buffer. This may be used multiple times to specify different
               buffers. When this option is used, the top level instance
               will not be stopped unless -t is given.
           -a
               Stop the trace for all existing buffer instances. When this
               option is used, the top level instance will not be stopped
               unless -t is given.
           -t
               Stops the top level instance buffer. Without the -B or -a
               option this is the same as the default. But if -B or -a is
               used, this is required if the top level instance buffer
               should also be stopped.
