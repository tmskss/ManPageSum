## NAME         top
           git-request-pull - Generates a summary of pending changes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git request-pull [-p] <start> <URL> [<end>]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Generate a request asking your upstream project to pull changes
           into their tree. The request, printed to the standard output,
           begins with the branch description, summarizes the changes and
           indicates from where they can be pulled.
           The upstream project is expected to have the commit named by
           <start> and the output asks it to integrate the changes you made
           since that commit, up to the commit named by <end>, by visiting
           the repository named by <URL>.
## OPTIONS         top
           -p
               Include patch text in the output.
           <start>
               Commit to start at. This names a commit that is already in
               the upstream history.
           <URL>
               The repository URL to be pulled from.
           <end>
               Commit to end at (defaults to HEAD). This names the commit at
               the tip of the history you are asking to be pulled.
               When the repository named by <URL> has the commit at a tip of
               a ref that is different from the ref you have locally, you
               can use the <local>:<remote> syntax, to have its local name,
               a colon :, and its remote name.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Imagine that you built your work on your master branch on top of
           the v1.0 release, and want it to be integrated to the project.
           First you push that change to your public repository for others
           to see:
               git push https://git.ko.xz/project master
           Then, you run this command:
               git request-pull v1.0 https://git.ko.xz/project master
           which will produce a request to the upstream, summarizing the
           changes between the v1.0 release and your master, to pull it from
           your public repository.
           If you pushed your change to a branch whose name is different
           from the one you have locally, e.g.
               git push https://git.ko.xz/project master:for-linus
           then you can ask that to be pulled with
               git request-pull v1.0 https://git.ko.xz/project master:for-linus
