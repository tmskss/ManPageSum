## NAME         top
           ppdmerge - merge ppd files (deprecated)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ppdmerge [ -o output-ppd-file ] ppd-file ppd-file [ ...  ppd-file
           ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ppdmerge merges two or more PPD files into a single, multi-
           language PPD file.  This program is deprecated and will be
           removed in a future release of CUPS.
## OPTIONS         top
           ppdmerge supports the following options:
           -o output-ppd-file
                  Specifies the PPD file to create.  If not specified, the
                  merged PPD file is written to the standard output.  If the
                  output file already exists, it is silently overwritten.
## NOTES         top
           PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a
           future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP
           can be supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
           ppdmerge does not check whether the merged PPD files are for the
           same device.  Merging of different device PPDs will yield
           unpredictable results.
