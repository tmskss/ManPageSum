## NAME         top
           stg-init - Initialize a StGit stack on a branch
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg init [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Initialize a StGit stack on a branch.
           Initializing a branch with a StGit stack commits initial, empty
           stack state for the branch to the repository. Theses stack
           metadata commits are tracked by the refs/stacks/<branch>
           reference. Updated stack state is committed by each StGit command
           that modifies the stack. StGit users do not have to do anything
           with the refs/stacks/<branch> ref directly.
           Some StGit commands, such as stg new and stg uncommit, will
           automatically initialize the stack, so it is often not necessary
           to explicitly initialize the stack on a branch. Also, branches
           created with stg branch --create are automatically initialized.
           The branch must already exist and point to a commit before
           initializing a StGit stack.
           StGit stack metadata can be deinitialized from a branch using stg
           branch --cleanup. See stg-branch(1) for more details.
## OPTIONS         top
           -b <branch>, --branch=<branch>
               Use <branch> instead of current branch
