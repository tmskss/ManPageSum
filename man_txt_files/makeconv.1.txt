## NAME         top
           makeconv - compile a converter table
## SYNOPSIS         top
           makeconv [ -h, -?, --help ] [ -c, --copyright ] [ -v, --verbose ]
           [ -d, --destdir destination ] convertertable ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           makeconv converts the ICU converter table convertertable into a
           binary file. The binary file has the same base name as
           convertertable but has a .cnv extension (instead of the typical
           .ucm extension of the convertertable file).  This binary file can
           then be read directly by ICU, or used by pkgdata(1) for
           incorporation into a larger archive or library.
           The convertertable must be in the ICU ucm (Unicode Codepage
           Mapping) format in order to be understood by makeconv.  The ICU
           ucm format is similar to the IBM NLTC upmap/tpmap/rpmap files.
           Comments in the convertertable are handled as follows. If a
           comment (starting with a `#' sign) that is after some text does
           contain the fallback indicator `|' then only the text starting
           with the `#' sign, and ending before the `|' sign, is ignored.
           Otherwise, or if the comment is the first thing on the line, the
           comment runs up to the end of the line. This special handling of
           comments is to accommodate the practice of putting fallback
           information in comments in the strict IBM NLTC ucmap format.
           Note that new converters will be automatically found by ICU after
           their installation in ICU's data directory. They do not need to
           be listed in the convrtrs.txt(5) converters aliases file in order
           to be available to applications using ICU.  They do need to be
           listed there if one wants to give them aliases, or tags, though.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h, -?, --help
                  Print help about usage and exit.
           -c, --copyright
                  Include a copyright notice in the binary data.
           -v, --verbose
                  Display extra informative messages during execution.
           -d, --destdir destination
                  Set the destination directory to destination.  The default
                  destination directory is specified by the environment
                  variable ICU_DATA.
## CAVEATS         top
           If an existing converter table is changed and recompiled using
           makeconv, the resulting binary file must be packaged in the same
           way that it was packaged initially. For example, if converters
           were grouped together in an archive or a library with pkgdata(1),
           then the archive or library must be rebuilt with the new binary
           file.  A standalone binary converter file will not take
           precedence over a packaged one.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           ICU_DATA
                  Specifies the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to
                  ${prefix}/share/icu/73.1/.  Some tools in ICU depend on
                  the presence of the trailing slash. It is thus important
                  to make sure that it is present if ICU_DATA is set.
