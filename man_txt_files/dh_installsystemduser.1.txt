## NAME         top
           dh_installsystemduser - install systemd unit files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installsystemduser [debhelper options] [--no-enable]
           [--name=name] [unit file ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installsystemduser finds the systemd user instance service
           files installed by a package and generates preinst, postinst, and
           prerm code blocks for enabling, disabling, starting, stopping,
           and restarting the corresponding systemd user instance services,
           when the package is installed, updated, or removed. These
           snippets are added to the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb(1).
           deb-systemd-helper(1) is used to enable and disable the systemd
           units, thus it is not necessary that the machine actually runs
           systemd during package installation time, enabling happens on all
           machines.
           dh_installsystemduser operates on all user instance unit files
           installed by a package. For only generating blocks for specific
           unit files, pass them as arguments. Specific unit files can be
           excluded from processing using the -X common debhelper(1) option.
## FILES         top
           debian/package.user.path, debian/package@.user.path,
           debian/package.user.service, debian/package@.user.service,
           debian/package.user.socket, debian/package@.user.socket,
           debian/package.user.target, debian/package@.user.target,
           debian/package.user.timer, debian/package@.user.timer
               If any of those files exists, they are installed into
               usr/lib/systemd/user/ in the package build directory removing
               the .user file name part.
## OPTIONS         top
           --name=name
               Install the service file as name.service instead of the
               default filename package.service. When this parameter is
               used, dh_installsystemd looks for and installs files named
               debian/package.name.user.service instead of the usual
               debian/package.user.service.  Moreover, maintainer scripts
               are only generated for units that match the given name.
           --no-enable
               Disable the service(s) on purge, but do not enable them on
               install.
## NOTES         top
           This command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
           between invocations of this command (with the same arguments).
           Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be
           added to maintainer scripts.
