## NAME         top
           shuf - generate random permutations
## SYNOPSIS         top
           shuf [OPTION]... [FILE]
           shuf -e [OPTION]... [ARG]...
           shuf -i LO-HI [OPTION]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Write a random permutation of the input lines to standard output.
           With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -e, --echo
                  treat each ARG as an input line
           -i, --input-range=LO-HI
                  treat each number LO through HI as an input line
           -n, --head-count=COUNT
                  output at most COUNT lines
           -o, --output=FILE
                  write result to FILE instead of standard output
           --random-source=FILE
                  get random bytes from FILE
           -r, --repeat
                  output lines can be repeated
           -z, --zero-terminated
                  line delimiter is NUL, not newline
