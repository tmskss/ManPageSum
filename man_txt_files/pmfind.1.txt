## NAME         top
           pmfind - find PCP services on the network
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmfind [-CqrSV?]  [-m mechanism] [-s service] [-t timeout]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmfind searches for instances of the specified PCP service being
           advertised on the network and prints a list of URLs corresponding
           to the services discovered.  It can be used in conjunction with
           pmfind_check(1) to automate the monitoring of remote PCP
           collector systems.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -C, --containers
                Performs containers discovery as well, for each discovered
                pmcd(1) service.
           -m mechanism, --mechanism=mechanism
                This option sets the mechanism that pmfind uses when
                performing service discovery.  By default, or if the keyword
                all is specified, every available mechanism will be used
                (iteratively).  See the ``MECHANISMS'' section for a
                description of each available discovery mechanism.
           -q, --quiet
                This option suppresses all output on the standard output
                stream.
           -r, --resolve
                Requests that DNS name resolution be attempted for the
                addresses of any discovered services.  The default is to
                display the network addresses of any discovered services.
           -s service, --service=service
                By default pmfind will search for all supported PCP
                services, however a specific PCP service to discover can be
                specified using the -s option.  Supported services are
                pmcd(1), and pmproxy(1).
           -S, --sources
                Reports source identifiers for each discovered pmcd(1)
                service.  These identifiers are unique for each host, and
                are formed using the (non-optional) context labels available
                for every PCP collector.  Because the discovery process will
                often identify multiple paths to an individual collector
                host, this option is an important part of the process of
                using pmfind in conjunction with pmfind_check(1), to ensure
                only one pmie(1) and/or pmlogger(1) process is started for
                each discovered collector host.  The source identifiers
                reported by pmfind are the same as the source identifiers
                reported by the pminfo(1) and pmseries(1) commands.
           -t seconds, --timeout=seconds
                Sets the maximum amount of time in seconds that pmfind will
                take before interrupting the service discovery.  The time
                argument is a floating point number representing the number
                of seconds before timing out.  The default is to take as
                much time as is needed to complete the process.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## MECHANISMS         top
           Supported mechanisms for service discovery are:
           avahi  Searches for services which are broadcasting using mDNS
                  via avahi-daemon(8).  An optional suffix ",timeout=N" may
                  be added to limit the amount of time waiting for the
                  avahi-daemon.  N is a floating point number specifying the
                  number of seconds to wait.  The default is 0.5 seconds.
                  This timeout may also be specified by setting the
                  environment variable AVAHI_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT to the
                  desired number of seconds.  If both are specified, then
                  the value specified in the environment variable takes
                  precedence.
           probe=<net-address>/<mask-bits>
                  Actively probes the given subnet for the requested PCP
                  service(s).  <net-address> is an Inet or IPv6 network
                  address and <mask-bits> is the number of bits used to
                  define the subnet.  For example, 192.168.1.0/24 defines an
                  8 bit subnet consisting of the addresses 192.168.1.0
                  through 192.168.1.255.  An optional suffix ",maxThreads=N"
                  may be added to limit the number of threads used while
                  probing.  The default is the value of FD_SETSIZE (which is
                  typically 1024) or the number of addresses in the subnet,
                  whichever is less.  An optional suffix ",timeout=N" may be
                  added to limit the amount of time spent waiting for each
                  connection attempt.  N is a floating point number
                  specifying the number of seconds to wait.  The default is
                  0.02 seconds (20 milliseconds).
           shell  Probes the list of addresses provided by scripts for
                  requested PCP service(s).  Several optional, comma-
                  separated parameters can also be provided.  The "path=DIR"
                  option specifies the directory where commands like
                  pcp-kube-pods(1) are located (defaults to
                  $PCP_BINADM_DIR/discover/).  This setting can be further
                  restricted to an individual command using the command=CMD
                  option, but the default is to use all available commands
                  from the path.  The "maxThreads=N" option limits the
                  number of threads used while probing.  The default is the
                  value of FD_SETSIZE (which is typically 1024) or the
                  number of addresses returned by the scripts, whichever is
                  less.  The "timeout=N" option may be added to limit the
                  amount of time spent waiting for each connection attempt.
                  N is a floating point number specifying the number of
                  seconds to wait.  The default is 0.02 seconds (20
                  milliseconds).
## SIGNALS         top
           pmfind will interrupt the service discovery process when one of
           the following signals is received: SIGHUP, SIGPIPE, SIGINT,
           SIGTERM, SIGXFSZ, SIGXCPU.  pmfind will report any results which
           were discovered up to point of the interruption.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           The value of the exit status from the command is zero when
           services were successfully located, one if no services were
           found, and two if an error occurred.
           In the event of an error a message will be generated on standard
           error that is intended to be self-explanatory.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/discover
                default path to address discovery scripts
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
