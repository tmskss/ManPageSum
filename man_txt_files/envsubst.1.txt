## NAME         top
           envsubst - substitutes environment variables in shell format
           strings
## SYNOPSIS         top
           envsubst [OPTION] [SHELL-FORMAT]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Substitutes the values of environment variables.
       Operation mode:
           -v, --variables
                  output the variables occurring in SHELL-FORMAT
       Informative output:
           -h, --help
                  display this help and exit
           -V, --version
                  output version information and exit
           In normal operation mode, standard input is copied to standard
           output, with references to environment variables of the form
           $VARIABLE or ${VARIABLE} being replaced with the corresponding
           values.  If a SHELL-FORMAT is given, only those environment
           variables that are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT are substituted;
           otherwise all environment variables references occurring in
           standard input are substituted.
           When --variables is used, standard input is ignored, and the
           output consists of the environment variables that are referenced
           in SHELL-FORMAT, one per line.

           The full documentation for envsubst is maintained as a Texinfo
           manual.  If the info and envsubst programs are properly installed
           at your site, the command
                  info envsubst
           should give you access to the complete manual.
