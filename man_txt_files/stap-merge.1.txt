## NAME         top
           stap-merge - systemtap per-cpu binary merger
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stap-merge [ OPTIONS ] [ INPUT FILENAMES ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The stap-merge executable applies when the -b option has been
           used while running a stap script.  The -b option will generate
           files per-cpu, based on the timestamp field. Then stap-merge will
           merge and sort through the per-cpu files based on the timestamp
           field.
## OPTIONS         top
           The systemtap merge executable supports the following options.
           -v     Verbose mode, displays three extra fields per set of
                  collected data.
                  [cpunumber,sequencenumberofdata,thelengthofthedataset]
           -o OUTPUT_FILENAME
                  Specify the name of the file you would like the output to
                  be redirected into.  If this option is not specified than
                  the output will be pushed to standard out.
## EXAMPLES         top
                  $ stap -v -b -e 'probe syscall.open { printf("%s(%d) open\n",
                  execname(), pid()) }'
           This should result in several stpd_cpu files (each labled with a
           number representing which cpu the file was produced from).
                  $ stap-merge -v stpd_cpu0 stpd_cpu1
           Running the stap-merge program in the same directory as the stap
           script earlier in the example, will produce an ordered sequence
           of packets with the three part label for each set of data.  This
           result will be pushed through the standard output.  An output
           file could have been specified using the "-o" option.
## FILES         top
           Important files and their corresponding paths can be located in
           the
                  stappaths (7) manual page.
