    OPENVT(1)                General Commands Manual               OPENVT(1)
## NAME         top
           openvt - start a program on a new virtual terminal (VT).
## SYNOPSIS         top
           openvt [-c vtnumber] [OPTIONS] [--] command
## DESCRIPTION         top
           openvt will find the first available VT, and run on it the given
           command with the given command options , standard input, output
           and error are directed to that terminal. The current search path
           ($PATH) is used to find the requested command. If no command is
           specified then the environment variable $SHELL is used.
       OPTIONS
           -c, --console=VTNUMBER
                  Use the given VT number and not the first available. Note
                  you must have write access to the supplied VT for this to
                  work.
           -f, --force
                  Force opening a VT without checking whether it is already
                  in use.
           -e, --exec
                  Directly execute the given command, without forking.  This
                  option is meant for use in /etc/inittab.
           -s, --switch
                  Switch to the new VT when starting the command. The VT of
                  the new command will be made the new current VT.
           -u, --user
                  Figure out the owner of the current VT, and run login as
                  that user.  Suitable to be called by init. Shouldn't be
                  used with -c or -l.
           -l, --login
                  Make the command a login shell. A - is prepended to the
                  name of the command to be executed.
           -v, --verbose
                  Be a bit more verbose.
           -w, --wait
                  wait for command to complete. If -w and -s are used
                  together then openvt will switch back to the controlling
                  terminal when the command completes.
           -V, --version
                  print program version and exit.
           -h, --help
                  show this text and exit.
           --     end of options to openvt.
## NOTE         top
           If openvt is compiled with a getopt_long() and you wish to set
           options to the command to be run, then you must supply the end of
           options -- flag before the command.
## EXAMPLES         top
           openvt can be used to start a shell on the next free VT, by using
           the command:
           openvt bash
           To start the shell as a login shell, use:
           openvt -l bash
           To get a long listing you must supply the -- separator:
           openvt -- ls -l
## HISTORY         top
           Earlier, openvt was called open.  It was written by Jon Tombs
           <jon@gtex02.us.es> or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>.  The -w idea is from
           "sam".
