## NAME         top
           dh_installsysusers - install and integrates systemd sysusers
           files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installsysusers [debhelper options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installsysusers is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           installing package maintainer supplied systemd sysusers files.
           It also finds the systemd sysusers files installed in a package
           and generates relevant integration snippets for enabling the
           users on installation.  These snippets are added to the package
           by dh_installdeb(1).
## FILES         top
           debian/package.sysusers
               If the file exist, it will be installed as
               /usr/lib/sysusers.d/package.conf.
## OPTIONS         top
           --name=name
               When this parameter is used, dh_installsysusers looks for and
               installs files named debian/package.name.sysusers instead of
               the usual debian/package.sysusers.
               Furthermore, the file is installed as
               /usr/lib/sysusers.d/name.conf rather than
               /usr/lib/sysusers.d/package.conf.
## NOTES         top
           This command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
           between invocations of this command (with the same arguments).
           Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be
           added to maintainer scripts.
