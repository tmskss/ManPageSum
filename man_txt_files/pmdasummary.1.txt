## NAME         top
           pmdasummary - summary performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary/pmdasummary [-d domain] [-h helpfile] [-l
           logfile] [-U username] pmie-command-line
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdasummary is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           derives performance metrics values from values made available by
           other PMDAs.  pmdasummary consists of two processes:
           pmie process
                  The inference engine for performance values pmie(1) is
                  used to periodically sample values for the base metrics
                  and compute the derived values.  This process is launched
                  with the given pmie-command-line arguments by the main
                  process, described below.
           main process
                  The main process reads and buffers the values computed by
                  pmie(1) and makes them available to the performance
                  metrics collector daemon pmcd(1).
           A brief description of the pmdasummary command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -h   This option specifies an alternative help text file helpfile
                for describing the metrics that pmdasummary represents.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                summary.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdasummary is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If
                the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           summary performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/summary
                # ./Remove
           pmdasummary is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdasummary
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
