## NAME         top
           git-multi-pack-index - Write and verify multi-pack-indexes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git multi-pack-index [--object-dir=<dir>] [--[no-]bitmap] <sub-command>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Write or verify a multi-pack-index (MIDX) file.
## OPTIONS         top
           --object-dir=<dir>
               Use given directory for the location of Git objects. We check
               <dir>/packs/multi-pack-index for the current MIDX file, and
               <dir>/packs for the pack-files to index.
               <dir> must be an alternate of the current repository.
           --[no-]progress
               Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
               progress is shown if standard error is connected to a
               terminal. Supported by sub-commands write, verify, expire,
               and `repack.
           The following subcommands are available:
           write
               Write a new MIDX file. The following options are available
               for the write sub-command:
               --preferred-pack=<pack>
                   Optionally specify the tie-breaking pack used when
                   multiple packs contain the same object.  <pack> must
                   contain at least one object. If not given, ties are
                   broken in favor of the pack with the lowest mtime.
               --[no-]bitmap
                   Control whether or not a multi-pack bitmap is written.
               --stdin-packs
                   Write a multi-pack index containing only the set of
                   line-delimited pack index basenames provided over stdin.
               --refs-snapshot=<path>
                   With --bitmap, optionally specify a file which contains a
                   "refs snapshot" taken prior to repacking.
                   A reference snapshot is composed of line-delimited OIDs
                   corresponding to the reference tips, usually taken by git
                   repack prior to generating a new pack. A line may
                   optionally start with a + character to indicate that the
                   reference which corresponds to that OID is "preferred"
                   (see git-config(1)'s pack.preferBitmapTips.)
                   The file given at <path> is expected to be readable, and
                   can contain duplicates. (If a given OID is given more
                   than once, it is marked as preferred if at least one
                   instance of it begins with the special + marker).
           verify
               Verify the contents of the MIDX file.
           expire
               Delete the pack-files that are tracked by the MIDX file, but
               have no objects referenced by the MIDX (with the exception of
               .keep packs and cruft packs). Rewrite the MIDX file afterward
               to remove all references to these pack-files.
           repack
               Create a new pack-file containing objects in small pack-files
               referenced by the multi-pack-index. If the size given by the
               --batch-size=<size> argument is zero, then create a pack
               containing all objects referenced by the multi-pack-index.
               For a non-zero batch size, Select the pack-files by examining
               packs from oldest-to-newest, computing the "expected size" by
               counting the number of objects in the pack referenced by the
               multi-pack-index, then divide by the total number of objects
               in the pack and multiply by the pack size. We select packs
               with expected size below the batch size until the set of
               packs have total expected size at least the batch size, or
               all pack-files are considered. If only one pack-file is
               selected, then do nothing. If a new pack-file is created,
               rewrite the multi-pack-index to reference the new pack-file.
               A later run of git multi-pack-index expire will delete the
               pack-files that were part of this batch.
               If repack.packKeptObjects is false, then any pack-files with
               an associated .keep file will not be selected for the batch
               to repack.
## EXAMPLES         top
           •   Write a MIDX file for the packfiles in the current .git
               directory.
                   $ git multi-pack-index write
           •   Write a MIDX file for the packfiles in the current .git
               directory with a corresponding bitmap.
                   $ git multi-pack-index write --preferred-pack=<pack> --bitmap
           •   Write a MIDX file for the packfiles in an alternate object
               store.
                   $ git multi-pack-index --object-dir <alt> write
           •   Verify the MIDX file for the packfiles in the current .git
               directory.
                   $ git multi-pack-index verify
