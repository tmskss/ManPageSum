           cups-config --cflags
           cups-config --datadir

## DESCRIPTION         top
           The cups-config command allows application developers to
           determine the necessary command-line options for the compiler and
           linker, as well as the installation directories for filters,
           configuration files, and drivers.  All values are reported to the
           standard output.
## OPTIONS         top
           The cups-config command accepts the following command-line
           options:
           --api-version
                Reports the current API version (major.minor).
           --build
                Reports a system-specific build number.
           --cflags
                Reports the necessary compiler options.
           --datadir
                Reports the default CUPS data directory.
           --help
                Reports the program usage message.
           --ldflags
                Reports the necessary linker options.
           --libs
                Reports the necessary libraries to link to.
           --serverbin
                Reports the default CUPS binary directory, where filters and
                backends are stored.
           --serverroot
                Reports the default CUPS configuration file directory.
           --static
                When used with --libs, reports the static libraries instead
                of the default (shared) libraries.
           --version
                Reports the full version number of the CUPS installation
                (major.minor.patch).
## EXAMPLES         top
           Show the currently installed version of CUPS:
               cups-config --version
           Compile a simple one-file CUPS filter:
               cc `cups-config --cflags --ldflags` -o filter filter.c \
                   `cups-config --libs`
## DEPRECATED OPTIONS         top
           The following options are deprecated but continue to work for
           backwards compatibility:
           --image
                Formerly used to add the CUPS imaging library to the list of
                libraries.
