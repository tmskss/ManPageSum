    GIT-INDEX-PACK(1)              Git Manual              GIT-INDEX-PACK(1)
## NAME         top
           git-index-pack - Build pack index file for an existing packed
           archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git index-pack [-v] [-o <index-file>] [--[no-]rev-index] <pack-file>
           git index-pack --stdin [--fix-thin] [--keep] [-v] [-o <index-file>]
                             [--[no-]rev-index] [<pack-file>]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, and
           builds a pack index file (.idx) for it. Optionally writes a
           reverse-index (.rev) for the specified pack. The packed archive
           together with the pack index can then be placed in the
           objects/pack/ directory of a Git repository.
## OPTIONS         top
           -v
               Be verbose about what is going on, including progress status.
           -o <index-file>
               Write the generated pack index into the specified file.
               Without this option the name of pack index file is
               constructed from the name of packed archive file by replacing
               .pack with .idx (and the program fails if the name of packed
               archive does not end with .pack).
           --[no-]rev-index
               When this flag is provided, generate a reverse index (a .rev
               file) corresponding to the given pack. If --verify is given,
               ensure that the existing reverse index is correct. Takes
               precedence over pack.writeReverseIndex.
           --stdin
               When this flag is provided, the pack is read from stdin
               instead and a copy is then written to <pack-file>. If
               <pack-file> is not specified, the pack is written to
               objects/pack/ directory of the current Git repository with a
               default name determined from the pack content. If <pack-file>
               is not specified consider using --keep to prevent a race
               condition between this process and git repack.
           --fix-thin
               Fix a "thin" pack produced by git pack-objects --thin (see
               git-pack-objects(1) for details) by adding the excluded
               objects the deltified objects are based on to the pack. This
               option only makes sense in conjunction with --stdin.
           --keep
               Before moving the index into its final destination create an
               empty .keep file for the associated pack file. This option is
               usually necessary with --stdin to prevent a simultaneous git
               repack process from deleting the newly constructed pack and
               index before refs can be updated to use objects contained in
               the pack.
           --keep=<msg>
               Like --keep create a .keep file before moving the index into
               its final destination, but rather than creating an empty file
               place <msg> followed by an LF into the .keep file. The <msg>
               message can later be searched for within all .keep files to
               locate any which have outlived their usefulness.
           --index-version=<version>[,<offset>]
               This is intended to be used by the test suite only. It allows
               to force the version for the generated pack index, and to
               force 64-bit index entries on objects located above the given
               offset.
           --strict
               Die, if the pack contains broken objects or links.
           --progress-title
               For internal use only.
               Set the title of the progress bar. The title is "Receiving
               objects" by default and "Indexing objects" when --stdin is
               specified.
           --check-self-contained-and-connected
               Die if the pack contains broken links. For internal use only.
           --fsck-objects
               For internal use only.
               Die if the pack contains broken objects. If the pack contains
               a tree pointing to a .gitmodules blob that does not exist,
               prints the hash of that blob (for the caller to check) after
               the hash that goes into the name of the pack/idx file (see
               "Notes").
           --threads=<n>
               Specifies the number of threads to spawn when resolving
               deltas. This requires that index-pack be compiled with
               pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a warning.
               This is meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor
               machines. The required amount of memory for the delta search
               window is however multiplied by the number of threads.
               Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of
               CPU’s and use maximum 3 threads.
           --max-input-size=<size>
               Die, if the pack is larger than <size>.
           --object-format=<hash-algorithm>
               Specify the given object format (hash algorithm) for the
               pack. The valid values are sha1 and (if enabled) sha256. The
               default is the algorithm for the current repository (set by
               extensions.objectFormat), or sha1 if no value is set or
               outside a repository.
               This option cannot be used with --stdin.
               THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL! SHA-256 support is experimental
               and still in an early stage. A SHA-256 repository will in
               general not be able to share work with "regular" SHA-1
               repositories. It should be assumed that, e.g., Git internal
               file formats in relation to SHA-256 repositories may change
               in backwards-incompatible ways. Only use
               --object-format=sha256 for testing purposes.
           --promisor[=<message>]
               Before committing the pack-index, create a .promisor file for
               this pack. Particularly helpful when writing a promisor pack
               with --fix-thin since the name of the pack is not final until
               the pack has been fully written. If a <message> is provided,
               then that content will be written to the .promisor file for
               future reference. See partial clone[1] for more information.
## NOTES         top
           Once the index has been created, the hash that goes into the name
           of the pack/idx file is printed to stdout. If --stdin was also
           used then this is prefixed by either "pack\t", or "keep\t" if a
           new .keep file was successfully created. This is useful to remove
           a .keep file used as a lock to prevent the race with git repack
           mentioned above.
