    GIT-DIAGNOSE(1)                Git Manual                GIT-DIAGNOSE(1)
## NAME         top
           git-diagnose - Generate a zip archive of diagnostic information
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git diagnose [(-o | --output-directory) <path>] [(-s | --suffix) <format>]
                          [--mode=<mode>]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Collects detailed information about the user’s machine, Git
           client, and repository state and packages that information into a
           zip archive. The generated archive can then, for example, be
           shared with the Git mailing list to help debug an issue or serve
           as a reference for independent debugging.
           By default, the following information is captured in the archive:
           •   git version --build-options
           •   The path to the repository root
           •   The available disk space on the filesystem
           •   The name and size of each packfile, including those in
               alternate object stores
           •   The total count of loose objects, as well as counts broken
               down by .git/objects subdirectory
           Additional information can be collected by selecting a different
           diagnostic mode using the --mode option.
           This tool differs from git-bugreport(1) in that it collects much
           more detailed information with a greater focus on reporting the
           size and data shape of repository contents.
## OPTIONS         top
           -o <path>, --output-directory <path>
               Place the resulting diagnostics archive in <path> instead of
               the current directory.
           -s <format>, --suffix <format>
               Specify an alternate suffix for the diagnostics archive name,
               to create a file named git-diagnostics-<formatted suffix>.
               This should take the form of a strftime(3) format string; the
               current local time will be used.
           --mode=(stats|all)
               Specify the type of diagnostics that should be collected. The
               default behavior of git diagnose is equivalent to
               --mode=stats.
               The --mode=all option collects everything included in
               --mode=stats, as well as copies of .git, .git/hooks,
               .git/info, .git/logs, and .git/objects/info directories. This
               additional information may be sensitive, as it can be used to
               reconstruct the full contents of the diagnosed repository.
               Users should exercise caution when sharing an archive
               generated with --mode=all.
