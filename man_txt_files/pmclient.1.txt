## NAME         top
           pmclient, pmclient_fg - a simple performance metrics client
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmclient [-PVz?]  [-a archive] [-A align] [-h host] [-n pmnsfile]
           [-O origin] [-s samples] [-S starttime] [-t interval] [-T
           endtime] [-Z timezone]
           pmclient_fg ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmclient and pmclient_fg are simple clients that use the
           Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) to
           report some high-level system performance metrics.
           The real value of these tools is as sample clients using the
           PMAPI(3), interfaces and to this end the source code is included
           with the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) package (see PCPIntro(1)),
           and is typically installed in /usr/share/pcp/demos/pmclient.
           The pmclient_fg program differs to pmclient in that it uses the
           fetchgroup API extension to the PMAPI, see pmFetchGroup(3).
           Normally pmclient operates on the distributed Performance Metrics
           Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is specified an
           alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file pmnsfile.
           Unless directed to another host by the -h option, or to an
           archive by the -a option, pmclient will contact the Performance
           Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host to obtain the
           required information.  The argument to -a is a comma-separated
           list of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive
           or the name of a directory containing one or more archives.  The
           -a and -h options are mutually exclusive.
           By default, pmclient reports the time of day according to the
           local timezone on the system where pmclient is run.  The -Z
           option changes the timezone to timezone in the format of the
           environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).  The -z
           option changes the timezone to the local timezone at the host
           that is the source of the performance metrics, as identified via
           either the -h or -a options.
           The output from pmclient is directed to standard output, and
           lists
           +  Aggregate CPU utilization, in the range 0 to 1.
           +  If the system has more than 1 CPU, the ordinal number of the
              busiest CPU, in the range 0 to ...
           +  If the system has more than 1 CPU, the CPU utilization for the
              busiest CPU.
           +  Real free memory in Mbytes.
           +  Aggregate physical disk I/O operations per second (IOPS).
           +  Load average over the last 1 minute and over the last 15
              minutes.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a archive, --archive=archive
                Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
                Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log files identified by
                the archive argument, which is a comma-separated list of
                names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
                the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
           -A align, --align=align
                Force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a
                natural time unit align.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
                complete description of the syntax for align.
           -h host, --host=host
                Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather than
                from the default localhost.
           -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
                Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5))
                from the file pmnsfile.
           -O origin, --origin=origin
                When reporting archived metrics, start reporting at origin
                within the time window (see -S and -T).  Refer to
                PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the syntax for
                origin.
           -P, --pause
                The default behavior for replaying a set of archives, is to
                replay at full speed.  The -P option may be used in
                conjunction with a set of archives, to request that the
                prevailing real-time delay be applied between samples (see
                -t) to effect a pause.
           -s samples, --samples=samples
                The samples argument defines the number of samples to be
                retrieved and reported.  If samples is 0 or -s is not
                specified, pmclient will sample and report continuously (in
                real time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives
                (in archive mode).
           -S starttime, --start=starttime
                The -S option may be used in conjunction with a set of
                archives to request that display start at the starttime from
                the start of the archive(s).  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
                complete description of the syntax for starttime.
           -t interval, --interval=interval
                Set the reporting interval to something other than the
                default 5 seconds.  The interval argument follows the syntax
                described in PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest form may be an
                unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are
                seconds).
           -T endtime, --finish=endtime
                When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
                restricted to those records logged before or at endtime.
                Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
                syntax for endtime.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -z, --hostzone
                Use the local timezone of the host that is the source of the
                performance metrics, as identified by either the -h or the
                -a options.  The default is to use the timezone of the local
                host.
           -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
                Use timezone for the date and time.  Timezone is in the
                format of the environment variable TZ as described in
                environ(7).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_DEMOS_DIR/pmclient
                source code, documentation, configuration files and Makefile
                when the PCP development package is installed
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
