    GETFACL(1)                Access Control Lists                GETFACL(1)
## NAME         top
           getfacl - get file access control lists
## SYNOPSIS         top
           getfacl [-aceEsRLPtpndvh] file ...
           getfacl [-aceEsRLPtpndvh] -
## DESCRIPTION         top
           For each file, getfacl displays the file name, owner, the group,
           and the Access Control List (ACL). If a directory has a default
           ACL, getfacl also displays the default ACL. Non-directories
           cannot have default ACLs.
           If getfacl is used on a file system that does not support ACLs,
           getfacl displays the access permissions defined by the
           traditional file mode permission bits.
           The output format of getfacl is as follows:
                   1:  # file: somedir/
                   2:  # owner: lisa
                   3:  # group: staff
                   4:  # flags: -s-
                   5:  user::rwx
                   6:  user:joe:rwx               #effective:r-x
                   7:  group::rwx                 #effective:r-x
                   8:  group:cool:r-x
                   9:  mask::r-x
                  10:  other::r-x
                  11:  default:user::rwx
                  12:  default:user:joe:rwx       #effective:r-x
                  13:  default:group::r-x
                  14:  default:mask::r-x
                  15:  default:other::---
           Lines 1--3 indicate the file name, owner, and owning group.
           Line 4 indicates the setuid (s), setgid (s), and sticky (t) bits:
           either the letter representing the bit, or else a dash (-). This
           line is included if any of those bits is set and left out
           otherwise, so it will not be shown for most files. (See
           CONFORMANCE TO POSIX 1003.1e DRAFT STANDARD 17 below.)
           Lines 5, 7 and 10 correspond to the user, group and other fields
           of the file mode permission bits. These three are called the base
           ACL entries. Lines 6 and 8 are named user and named group
           entries. Line 9 is the effective rights mask. This entry limits
           the effective rights granted to all groups and to named users.
           (The file owner and others permissions are not affected by the
           effective rights mask; all other entries are.)  Lines 11--15
           display the default ACL associated with this directory.
           Directories may have a default ACL. Regular files never have a
           default ACL.
           The default behavior for getfacl is to display both the ACL and
           the default ACL, and to include an effective rights comment for
           lines where the rights of the entry differ from the effective
           rights.
           If output is to a terminal, the effective rights comment is
           aligned to column 40. Otherwise, a single tab character separates
           the ACL entry and the effective rights comment.
           The ACL listings of multiple files are separated by blank lines.
           The output of getfacl can also be used as input to setfacl.
       PERMISSIONS
           Process with search access to a file (i.e., processes with read
           access to the containing directory of a file) are also granted
           read access to the file's ACLs.  This is analogous to the
           permissions required for accessing the file mode.
## OPTIONS         top
           -a, --access
               Display the file access control list.
           -d, --default
               Display the default access control list.
           -c, --omit-header
               Do not display the comment header (the first three lines of
               each file's output).
           -e, --all-effective
               Print all effective rights comments, even if identical to the
               rights defined by the ACL entry.
           -E, --no-effective
               Do not print effective rights comments.
           -s, --skip-base
               Skip files that only have the base ACL entries (owner, group,
               others).
           -R, --recursive
               List the ACLs of all files and directories recursively.
           -L, --logical
               Logical walk, follow symbolic links to directories. The
               default behavior is to follow symbolic link arguments, and
               skip symbolic links encountered in subdirectories.  Only
               effective in combination with -R.
           -P, --physical
               Physical walk, do not follow symbolic links to directories.
               This also skips symbolic link arguments.  Only effective in
               combination with -R.
           -t, --tabular
               Use an alternative tabular output format. The ACL and the
               default ACL are displayed side by side. Permissions that are
               ineffective due to the ACL mask entry are displayed
               capitalized. The entry tag names for the ACL_USER_OBJ and
               ACL_GROUP_OBJ entries are also displayed in capital letters,
               which helps in spotting those entries.
           -p, --absolute-names
               Do not strip leading slash characters (`/'). The default
               behavior is to strip leading slash characters.
           -n, --numeric
               List numeric user and group IDs
           -v, --version
               Print the version of getfacl and exit.
           -h, --help
               Print help explaining the command line options.
           --  End of command line options. All remaining parameters are
               interpreted as file names, even if they start with a dash
               character.
           -   If the file name parameter is a single dash character,
               getfacl reads a list of files from standard input.
## CONFORMANCE TO POSIX 1003.1e DRAFT STANDARD 17         top
           If the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined, the
           default behavior of getfacl changes in the following ways: Unless
           otherwise specified, only the ACL is printed. The default ACL is
           only printed if the -d option is given. If no command line
           parameter is given, getfacl behaves as if it was invoked as
           ``getfacl -''.  No flags comments indicating the setuid, setgid,
           and sticky bits are generated.
