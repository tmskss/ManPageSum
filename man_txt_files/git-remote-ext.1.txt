    GIT-REMOTE-EXT(1)              Git Manual              GIT-REMOTE-EXT(1)
## NAME         top
           git-remote-ext - Bridge smart transport to external command.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git remote add <nick> "ext::<command>[ <arguments>...]"
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This remote helper uses the specified <command> to connect to a
           remote Git server.
           Data written to stdin of the specified <command> is assumed to be
           sent to a git:// server, git-upload-pack, git-receive-pack or
           git-upload-archive (depending on situation), and data read from
           stdout of <command> is assumed to be received from the same
           service.
           Command and arguments are separated by an unescaped space.
           The following sequences have a special meaning:
           '% '
               Literal space in command or argument.
           %%
               Literal percent sign.
           %s
               Replaced with name (receive-pack, upload-pack, or
               upload-archive) of the service Git wants to invoke.
           %S
               Replaced with long name (git-receive-pack, git-upload-pack,
               or git-upload-archive) of the service Git wants to invoke.
           %G (must be the first characters in an argument)
               This argument will not be passed to <command>. Instead, it
               will cause the helper to start by sending git:// service
               requests to the remote side with the service field set to an
               appropriate value and the repository field set to rest of the
               argument. Default is not to send such a request.
               This is useful if remote side is git:// server accessed over
               some tunnel.
           %V (must be first characters in argument)
               This argument will not be passed to <command>. Instead it
               sets the vhost field in the git:// service request (to rest
               of the argument). Default is not to send vhost in such
               request (if sent).
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           GIT_TRANSLOOP_DEBUG
               If set, prints debugging information about various
               reads/writes.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES PASSED TO COMMAND         top
           GIT_EXT_SERVICE
               Set to long name (git-upload-pack, etc...) of service helper
               needs to invoke.
           GIT_EXT_SERVICE_NOPREFIX
               Set to long name (upload-pack, etc...) of service helper
               needs to invoke.
## EXAMPLES         top
           This remote helper is transparently used by Git when you use
           commands such as "git fetch <URL>", "git clone <URL>", , "git
           push <URL>" or "git remote add <nick> <URL>", where <URL> begins
           with ext::. Examples:
           "ext::ssh -i /home/foo/.ssh/somekey user@host.example %S
           foo/repo"
               Like host.example:foo/repo, but use /home/foo/.ssh/somekey as
               keypair and user as user on remote side. This avoids needing
               to edit .ssh/config.
           "ext::socat -t3600 - ABSTRACT-CONNECT:/git-server %G/somerepo"
               Represents repository with path /somerepo accessible over git
               protocol at abstract namespace address /git-server.
           "ext::git-server-alias foo %G/repo"
               Represents a repository with path /repo accessed using the
               helper program "git-server-alias foo". The path to the
               repository and type of request are not passed on the command
               line but as part of the protocol stream, as usual with git://
               protocol.
           "ext::git-server-alias foo %G/repo %Vfoo"
               Represents a repository with path /repo accessed using the
               helper program "git-server-alias foo". The hostname for the
               remote server passed in the protocol stream will be "foo"
               (this allows multiple virtual Git servers to share a
               link-level address).
           "ext::git-server-alias foo %G/repo% with% spaces %Vfoo"
               Represents a repository with path /repo with spaces accessed
               using the helper program "git-server-alias foo". The hostname
               for the remote server passed in the protocol stream will be
               "foo" (this allows multiple virtual Git servers to share a
               link-level address).
           "ext::git-ssl foo.example /bar"
               Represents a repository accessed using the helper program
               "git-ssl foo.example /bar". The type of request can be
               determined by the helper using environment variables (see
               above).
