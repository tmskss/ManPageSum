## NAME         top
           passwd - change user password
## SYNOPSIS         top
           passwd [options] [LOGIN]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The passwd command changes passwords for user accounts. A normal
           user may only change the password for their own account, while
           the superuser may change the password for any account.  passwd
           also changes the account or associated password validity period.
       Password Changes
           The user is first prompted for their old password, if one is
           present. This password is then encrypted and compared against the
           stored password. The user has only one chance to enter the
           correct password. The superuser is permitted to bypass this step
           so that forgotten passwords may be changed.
           After the password has been entered, password aging information
           is checked to see if the user is permitted to change the password
           at this time. If not, passwd refuses to change the password and
           exits.
           The user is then prompted twice for a replacement password. The
           second entry is compared against the first and both are required
           to match in order for the password to be changed.
           Then, the password is tested for complexity.  passwd will reject
           any password which is not suitably complex. Care must be taken
           not to include the system default erase or kill characters.
       Hints for user passwords
           The security of a password depends upon the strength of the
           encryption algorithm and the size of the key space. The legacy
           UNIX System encryption method is based on the NBS DES algorithm.
           More recent methods are now recommended (see ENCRYPT_METHOD). The
           size of the key space depends upon the randomness of the password
           which is selected.
           Compromises in password security normally result from careless
           password selection or handling. For this reason, you should not
           select a password which appears in a dictionary or which must be
           written down. The password should also not be a proper name, your
           license number, birth date, or street address. Any of these may
           be used as guesses to violate system security.
           As a general guideline, passwords should be long and random. It's
           fine to use simple character sets, such as passwords consisting
           only of lowercase letters, if that helps memorizing longer
           passwords. For a password consisting only of lowercase English
           letters randomly chosen, and a length of 32, there are 26^32
           (approximately 2^150) different possible combinations. Being an
           exponential equation, it's apparent that the exponent (the
           length) is more important than the base (the size of the
           character set).
           You can find advice on how to choose a strong password on
           http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength
## OPTIONS         top
           The options which apply to the passwd command are:
           -a, --all
               This option can be used only with -S and causes show status
               for all users.
           -d, --delete
               Delete a user's password (make it empty). This is a quick way
               to disable a password for an account. It will set the named
               account passwordless.
           -e, --expire
               Immediately expire an account's password. This in effect can
               force a user to change their password at the user's next
               login.
           -h, --help
               Display help message and exit.
           -i, --inactive INACTIVE
               This option is used to disable an account after the password
               has been expired for a number of days. After a user account
               has had an expired password for INACTIVE days, the user may
               no longer sign on to the account.
           -k, --keep-tokens
               Indicate password change should be performed only for expired
               authentication tokens (passwords). The user wishes to keep
               their non-expired tokens as before.
           -l, --lock
               Lock the password of the named account. This option disables
               a password by changing it to a value which matches no
               possible encrypted value (it adds a ´!´ at the beginning of
               the password).
               Note that this does not disable the account. The user may
               still be able to login using another authentication token
               (e.g. an SSH key). To disable the account, administrators
               should use usermod --expiredate 1 (this set the account's
               expire date to Jan 2, 1970).
               Users with a locked password are not allowed to change their
               password.
           -n, --mindays MIN_DAYS
               Set the minimum number of days between password changes to
               MIN_DAYS. A value of zero for this field indicates that the
               user may change their password at any time.
           -q, --quiet
               Quiet mode.
           -r, --repository REPOSITORY
               change password in REPOSITORY repository
           -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
               Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the
               configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR directory. Only
               absolute paths are supported.
           -S, --status
               Display account status information. The status information
               consists of 7 fields. The first field is the user's login
               name. The second field indicates if the user account has a
               locked password (L), has no password (NP), or has a usable
               password (P). The third field gives the date of the last
               password change. The next four fields are the minimum age,
               maximum age, warning period, and inactivity period for the
               password. These ages are expressed in days.
           -u, --unlock
               Unlock the password of the named account. This option
               re-enables a password by changing the password back to its
               previous value (to the value before using the -l option).
           -w, --warndays WARN_DAYS
               Set the number of days of warning before a password change is
               required. The WARN_DAYS option is the number of days prior to
               the password expiring that a user will be warned that their
               password is about to expire.
           -x, --maxdays MAX_DAYS
               Set the maximum number of days a password remains valid.
               After MAX_DAYS, the password is required to be changed.
               Passing the number -1 as MAX_DAYS will remove checking a
               password's validity.
## CAVEATS         top
           Password complexity checking may vary from site to site. The user
           is urged to select a password as complex as he or she feels
           comfortable with.
           Users may not be able to change their password on a system if NIS
           is enabled and they are not logged into the NIS server.
           passwd uses PAM to authenticate users and to change their
           passwords.
## FILES         top
           /etc/passwd
               User account information.
           /etc/shadow
               Secure user account information.
           /etc/pam.d/passwd
               PAM configuration for passwd.
## EXIT VALUES         top
           The passwd command exits with the following values:
           0
               success

               permission denied
           2
               invalid combination of options
           3
               unexpected failure, nothing done
           4
               unexpected failure, passwd file missing
