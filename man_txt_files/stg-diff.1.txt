## NAME         top
           stg-diff - Show a diff
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg diff [OPTIONS] [path]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Show the diff (default) or diffstat between the current working
           copy or a tree-ish object and another tree-ish object (defaulting
           to HEAD). File names can also be given to restrict the diff
           output. The tree-ish object has the format accepted by the
           stg-id(1) command.
## OPTIONS         top
           -r <revspec>, --range=<revspec>
               Show diff between specified revisions. Revisions ranges are
               specified as rev1[..[rev2]]. The revisions may be standard
               Git revision specifiers or patches.
           -s, --stat
               Show the stat instead of the diff
           -O <option>, --diff-opt=<option>
               Pass additional <option> to git diff.
               See the git-diff(1) man page. This option may be specified
               multiple times.
