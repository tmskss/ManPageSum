## NAME         top
           flatpak-build-init - Initialize a build directory
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak build-init [OPTION...] DIRECTORY APPNAME SDK RUNTIME
                              [BRANCH]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Initializes a separate build directory.  DIRECTORY is the name of
           the directory.  APPNAME is the application id of the app that
           will be built.  SDK and RUNTIME specify the sdk and runtime that
           the application should be built against and run in.  BRANCH
           specify the version of sdk and runtime
           Initializes a directory as build directory which can be used as
           target directory of flatpak build. It creates a metadata inside
           the given directory. Additionally, empty files and var
           subdirectories are created.
           It is an error to run build-init on a directory that has already
           been initialized as a build directory.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           --arch=ARCH
               The architecture to use. See flatpak --supported-arches for
               architectures supported by the host.
           -v, --var=RUNTIME
               Initialize var from the named runtime.
           -w, --writable-sdk
               Initialize /usr with a copy of the sdk, which is writable
               during flatpak build. This can be used if you need to install
               build tools in /usr during the build. This is stored in the
               usr subdirectory of the app dir, but will not be part of the
               final app.
           --tag=TAG
               Add a tag to the metadata file. This option can be used
               multiple times.
           --sdk-extension=EXTENSION
               When using --writable-sdk, in addition to the sdk, also
               install the specified extension. This option can be used
               multiple times.
           --extension=NAME=VARIABLE[=VALUE]
               Add extension point info.
           --sdk-dir
               Specify a custom subdirectory to use instead of usr for
               --writable-sdk.
           --update
               Re-initialize the sdk and var, don't fail if already
               initialized.
           --base=APP
               Initialize the application with files from another specified
               application.
           --base-version=VERSION
               Specify the version to use for --base. If not specified, will
               default to "master".
           --base-extension=EXTENSION
               When using --base, also install the specified extension from
               the app. This option can be used multiple times.
           --type=TYPE
               This can be used to build different types of things. The
               default is "app" which is a regular app, but "runtime"
               creates a runtime based on an existing runtime, and
               "extension" creates an extension for an app or runtime.
           --extension-tag=EXTENSION_TAG
               If building an extension, the tag to use when searching for
               the mount point of the extension.
           --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
