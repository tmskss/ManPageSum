## NAME         top
           pmdaxfs - XFS filesystem performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs/pmdaxfs [-d domain] [-l logfile]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdaxfs is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts performance metrics describing the state of the XFS
           filesystem from the Linux kernel.
           The xfs PMDA exports metrics that measure information about
           metadata buffer usage, the journal, btree operations, inode
           operations, extended attributes, directories, quotas, read and
           write operation counts and of course throughput.
           The PMDA provides a facility to reset the values of all counters
           to zero using pmstore(1) with the xfs.control.reset metric.
           A brief description of the pmdaxfs command line options follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                xfs.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
                pmdaxfs is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
                file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
                to the standard error instead.
## INSTALLATION         top
           The xfs PMDA is installed and available by default on Linux.  If
           you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs
                # ./Remove
           If you want to establish access to the names, help text and
           values for the XFS performance metrics once more, after removal,
           do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs
                # ./Install
           pmdaxfs is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

                  from pmdaxfs
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
