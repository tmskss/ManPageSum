## NAME         top
           dh_installwm - register a window manager
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installwm [debhelper options] [-n] [--priority=n] [wm ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installwm is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           generating the postinst and prerm commands that register a window
           manager with update-alternatives(8). The window manager's man
           page is also registered as a slave symlink (in v6 mode and up).
           It must be installed in usr/share/man/man1/ in the package build
           directory prior to calling dh_installwm.  In compat 9 and
           earlier, the manpage was optional.
## FILES         top
           debian/package.wm
               List window manager programs to register.
               Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
               documented in debhelper(7).
## OPTIONS         top
           --priority=n
               Set the priority of the window manager. Default is 20, which
               is too low for most window managers; see the Debian Policy
               document for instructions on calculating the correct value.
           -n, --no-scripts
               Do not modify postinst/prerm scripts. Turns this command into
               a no-op.
           -A, --all
               Modify scripts for window managers specified by command line
               parameters in ALL packages acted on, not just the first.
           wm ...
               Window manager programs to register.
## NOTES         top
           Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
           called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may
           cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
           maintainer scripts.
## SEE ALSO         top
