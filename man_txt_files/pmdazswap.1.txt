## NAME         top
           pmdazswap - zswap (compressed swap) PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdazswap is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values about compressed swap operation, as tracked
           by the zswap Linux kernel module.
           Zswap is a lightweight compressed cache for swap pages.  It takes
           pages that are in the process of being swapped out and attempts
           to compress them into a dynamically allocated RAM-based memory
           pool.  Zswap trades CPU cycles for potentially reduced swap I/O.
           This tradeoff can also result in a performance improvement if
           reads from the compressed cache are faster than reads from a swap
           device.
           This PMDA exports metrics about pool size, number of pages
           stored, and various counters for the reasons pages are rejected.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install the zswap PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zswap
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zswap
               # ./Remove
           pmdazswap is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top

               installation script for the pmdazswap agent

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
