    STRINGS(1P)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            STRINGS(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           strings — find printable strings in files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           strings [-a] [-t format] [-n number] [file...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The strings utility shall look for printable strings in regular
           files and shall write those strings to standard output. A
           printable string is any sequence of four (by default) or more
           printable characters terminated by a <newline> or NUL character.
           Additional implementation-defined strings may be written; see
           localedef.
           If the first argument is '-', the results are unspecified.
## OPTIONS         top
           The strings utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
           for the unspecified usage of '-'.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -a        Scan files in their entirety. If -a is not specified,
                     it is implementation-defined what portion of each file
                     is scanned for strings.
           -n number Specify the minimum string length, where the number
                     argument is a positive decimal integer. The default
                     shall be 4.
           -t format Write each string preceded by its byte offset from the
                     start of the file. The format shall be dependent on the
                     single character used as the format option-argument:
                     d     The offset shall be written in decimal.
                     o     The offset shall be written in octal.
                     x     The offset shall be written in hexadecimal.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of a regular file to be used as input. If no
                     file operand is specified, the strings utility shall
                     read from the standard input.
## STDIN         top
           See the INPUT FILES section.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The input files named by the utility arguments or the standard
           input shall be regular files of any format.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           strings:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files) and to
                     identify printable strings.
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Strings found shall be written to the standard output, one per
           line.
           When the -t option is not specified, the format of the output
           shall be:
               "%s", <string>
           With the -t o option, the format of the output shall be:
               "%o %s", <byte offset>, <string>
           With the -t x option, the format of the output shall be:
               "%x %s", <byte offset>, <string>
           With the -t d option, the format of the output shall be:
               "%d %s", <byte offset>, <string>
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           By default the data area (as opposed to the text, ``bss'', or
           header areas) of a binary executable file is scanned.
           Implementations document which areas are scanned.
           Some historical implementations do not require NUL or <newline>
           terminators for strings to permit those languages that do not use
           NUL as a string terminator to have their strings written.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           Apart from rationalizing the option syntax and slight
           difficulties with object and executable binary files, strings is
           specified to match historical practice closely. The -a and -n
           options were introduced to replace the non-conforming - and
           -number options. These options are no longer specified by
           POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in some implementations.
           The -o option historically means different things on different
           implementations. Some use it to mean ``offset in decimal'', while
           others use it as ``offset in octal''. Instead of trying to decide
           which way would be least objectionable, the -t option was added.
           It was originally named -O to mean ``offset'', but was changed to
           -t to be consistent with od.
           The ISO C standard function isprint() is restricted to a domain
           of unsigned char.  This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires
           implementations to write strings as defined by the current
           locale.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
