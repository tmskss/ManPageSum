## NAME         top
           stg-pop - Pop (unapply) one or more applied patches
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg pop [OPTIONS] [patch]...
           stg pop [OPTIONS] --all
           stg pop [OPTIONS] -n <number>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Pop (unapply) one or more applied patches.
           By default, the topmost applied patch is popped.
           If ranges of patches are specified, pop and push operations are
           performed such that only the patches specified on the command
           line are unapplied at the end of the operation. It is possible
           for some of these intermediate push operations to fail due to
           conflicts if patches are popped out of last-pushed first-popped
           order.
## OPTIONS         top
           -a, --all
               Pop all applied patches
           -n <number>, --number=<number>
               Pop the specified <number> of patches.
               A negative number indicates to pop all but that number of
               patches
           -s, --spill
               Keep patches' modifications in working tree after popping
           -k, --keep
               Keep the local changes
