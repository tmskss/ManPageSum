## NAME         top
           dh_prep - perform cleanups in preparation for building a binary
           package
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_prep [debhelper options] [-Xitem]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_prep is a debhelper program that performs some file cleanups
           in preparation for building a binary package. (This is what
           dh_clean -k used to do.) It removes the package build
           directories, debian/tmp, and some temp files that are generated
           when building a binary package.
           It is typically run at the top of the binary-arch and binary-
           indep targets, or at the top of a target such as install that
           they depend on.
## OPTIONS         top
           -Xitem --exclude=item
               Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename
               from being deleted, even if they would normally be deleted.
               You may use this option multiple times to build up a list of
               things to exclude.
## SEE ALSO         top
           debhelper(7)
           This program is a part of debhelper.
