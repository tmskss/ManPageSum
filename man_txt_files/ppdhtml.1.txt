## NAME         top
           ppdhtml - cups html summary generator (deprecated)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ppdhtml [ -D name[=value] ] [ -I include-directory ] source-file
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ppdhtml reads a driver information file and produces a HTML
           summary page that lists all of the drivers in a file and the
           supported options.  This program is deprecated and will be
           removed in a future release of CUPS.
## OPTIONS         top
           ppdhtml supports the following options:
           -D name[=value]
                Sets the named variable for use in the source file.  It is
                equivalent to using the #define directive in the source
                file.
           -I include-directory
                Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I
                options can be supplied to add additional directories.
## NOTES         top
           PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a
           future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP
           can be supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
