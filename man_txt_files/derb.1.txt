## NAME         top
           derb - disassemble a resource bundle
## SYNOPSIS         top
           derb [ -h, -?, --help ] [ -V, --version ] [ -v, --verbose ] [ -e,
           --encoding encoding ] [ --bom ] [ -t, --truncate [ size ] ] [ -s,
           --sourcedir source ] [ -d, --destdir destination ] [ -i,
           --icudatadir directory ] [ -c, --to-stdout ] bundle ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           derb reads the compiled resource bundle files passed on the
           command line and write them back in text form.  The resulting
           text files have a .txt extension while compiled resource bundle
           source files typically have a .res extension.
           It is customary to name the resource bundles by their locale
           name, i.e. to use a local identifier for the bundle filename,
           e.g.  ja_JP.res for Japanese (Japan) data, or root.res for the
           root bundle.  This is especially important for derb since the
           locale name is not accessible directly from the compiled resource
           bundle, and to know which locale to ask for when opening the
           bundle.  derb will produce a file whose base name is the base
           name of the compiled resource file itself.  If the --to-stdout,
           -c option is used, however, the text will be written on the
           standard output.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h, -?, --help
                  Print help about usage and exit.
           -V, --version
                  Print the version of derb and exit.
           -v, --verbose
                  Display extra informative messages during execution.
           -A, --suppressAliases
                  Don't follow aliases when producing output.
           -e, --encoding encoding
                  Set the encoding used to write output files to encoding.
                  The default encoding is the invariant (subset of ASCII or
                  EBCDIC) codepage for the system (see section INVARIANT
                  CHARACTERS).  The choice of the encoding does not affect
                  the data, just their representation. Characters that
                  cannot be represented in the encoding will be represented
                  using \uhhhh escape sequences.
           --bom  Write a byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the
                  file.
           -l, --locale locale
                  Set the locale for the resource bundle, which is used both
                  in the generated text and as the base name of the output
                  file.
           -t, --truncate [ size ]
                  Truncate individual resources (strings or binary data) to
                  size bytes. The default if size is not specified is 80
                  bytes.
           -s, --sourcedir source
                  Set the source directory to source.  The default source
                  directory is the current directory.  If - is passed for
                  source, then the bundle will be looked for in its default
                  location, specified by the ICU_DATA environment variable
                  (or defaulting to the location set when ICU was built if
                  ICU_DATA is not set).
           -d, --destdir destination
                  Set the destination directory to destination.  The default
                  destination directory is specified by the environment
                  variable ICU_DATA or is the location set when ICU was
                  built if ICU_DATA is not set.
           -i, --icudatadir directory
                  Look for any necessary ICU data files in directory.  For
                  example, when processing collation overrides, the file
                  ucadata.dat must be located.  The default ICU data
                  directory is specified by the environment variable
                  ICU_DATA.
           -c, --to-stdout
                  Write the disassembled bundle on standard output instead
                  of into a file.
## CAVEATS         top
           When the option --bom is used, the character U+FEFF is written in
           the destination encoding regardless of whether it is a Unicode
           transformation format (UTF) or not.  This option should only be
           used with an UTF encoding, as byte order marks are not meaningful
           for other encodings.
## INVARIANT CHARACTERS         top
           The invariant character set consists of the following set of
           characters, expressed as a standard POSIX regular expression: [a-
           z]|[A-Z]|[0-9]|_| |+|-|*|/.  This is the set which is guaranteed
           to be available regardless of code page.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           ICU_DATA
                  Specifies the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to
                  ${prefix}/share/icu/73.1/.  Some tools in ICU depend on
                  the presence of the trailing slash. It is thus important
                  to make sure that it is present if ICU_DATA is set.
