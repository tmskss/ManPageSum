## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           logger — log messages
## SYNOPSIS         top
           logger string...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The logger utility saves a message, in an unspecified manner and
           format, containing the string operands provided by the user. The
           messages are expected to be evaluated later by personnel
           performing system administration tasks.
           It is implementation-defined whether messages written in locales
           other than the POSIX locale are effective.
## OPTIONS         top
           None.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           string    One of the string arguments whose contents are
                     concatenated together, in the order specified,
                     separated by single <space> characters.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           logger:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error. (This means diagnostics from logger to
                     the user or application, not diagnostic messages that
                     the user is sending to the system administrator.)
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           Unspecified.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           This utility allows logging of information for later use by a
           system administrator or programmer in determining why non-
           interactive utilities have failed. The locations of the saved
           messages, their format, and retention period are all unspecified.
           There is no method for a conforming application to read messages,
           once written.
## EXAMPLES         top
           A batch application, running non-interactively, tries to read a
           configuration file and fails; it may attempt to notify the system
           administrator with:
               logger myname: unable to read file foo. [timestamp]
## RATIONALE         top
           The standard developers believed strongly that some method of
           alerting administrators to errors was necessary. The obvious
           example is a batch utility, running non-interactively, that is
           unable to read its configuration files or that is unable to
           create or write its results file. However, the standard
           developers did not wish to define the format or delivery
           mechanisms as they have historically been (and will probably
           continue to be) very system-specific, as well as involving
           functionality clearly outside the scope of this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017.
           The text with LC_MESSAGES about diagnostic messages means
           diagnostics from logger to the user or application, not
           diagnostic messages that the user is sending to the system
           administrator.
           Multiple string arguments are allowed, similar to echo, for ease-
           of-use.
           Like the utilities mailx and lp, logger is admittedly difficult
           to test. This was not deemed sufficient justification to exclude
           these utilities from this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. It is also
           arguable that they are, in fact, testable, but that the tests
           themselves are not portable.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
