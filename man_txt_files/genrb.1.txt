    GENRB(1)                     ICU 73.1 Manual                    GENRB(1)
## NAME         top
           genrb - compile a resource bundle
## SYNOPSIS         top
           genrb [ -h, -?, --help ] [ -V, --version ] [ -v, --verbose ] [
           -e, --encoding encoding ] [ -j, --write-java [ encoding ] ] [ -s,
           --sourcedir source ] [ -d, --destdir destination ] [ -i,
           --icudatadir directory ] bundle ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           genrb converts the resource bundle source files passed on the
           command line to their binary form or to a Java source file for
           use with ICU4J.  The resulting binary files have a .res extension
           while resource bundle source files typically have a .txt
           extension. Java source files have a java extension and follow the
           ICU4J naming conventions.
           It is customary to name the resource bundles by their locale
           name, i.e. to use a local identifier for the bundle filename,
           e.g.  ja_JP.txt for Japanese (Japan) data, or root.txt for the
           root bundle.  In any case, genrb will produce a file whose base
           name is the name of the locale found in the resource file, not
           the base name of the resource file itself.
           The binary files can be read directly by ICU, or used by
           pkgdata(1) for incorporation into a larger archive or library.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h, -?, --help
                  Print help about usage and exit.
           -V, --version
                  Print the version of genrb and exit.
           -v, --verbose
                  Display extra informative messages during execution.
           -e, --encoding encoding
                  Set the encoding used to read input files to encoding.
                  The default encoding is the invariant (subset of ASCII or
                  EBCDIC) codepage for the system (see section INVARIANT
                  CHARACTERS).  The encodings UTF-8, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE
                  are automatically detected if a byte order mark (BOM) is
                  present.
           -j, --write-java [ encoding ]
                  Generate a Java source code for use with ICU4J. An
                  optional encoding for the Java file can be given.
           -s, --sourcedir source
                  Set the source directory to source.  The default source
                  directory is specified by the environment variable
                  ICU_DATA, or the location set when ICU was built if
                  ICU_DATA is not set.
           -d, --destdir destination
                  Set the destination directory to destination.  The default
                  destination directory is specified by the environment
                  variable ICU_DATA or is the location set when ICU was
                  built if ICU_DATA is not set.
           -i, --icudatadir directory
                  Look for any necessary ICU data files in directory.  For
                  example, when processing collation overrides, the file
                  ucadata.dat must be located.  The default ICU data
                  directory is specified by the environment variable
                  ICU_DATA.
## INVARIANT CHARACTERS         top
           The invariant character set consists of the following set of
           characters, expressed as a standard POSIX regular expression: [a-
           z]|[A-Z]|[0-9]|_| |+|-|*|/.  This is the set which is guaranteed
           to be available regardless of code page.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           ICU_DATA
                  Specifies the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to
                  ${prefix}/share/icu/73.1/.  Some tools in ICU depend on
                  the presence of the trailing slash. It is thus important
                  to make sure that it is present if ICU_DATA is set.
