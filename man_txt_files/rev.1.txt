## NAME         top
           rev - reverse lines characterwise
## SYNOPSIS         top
           rev [option] [file...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The rev utility copies the specified files to standard output,
           reversing the order of characters in every line. If no files are
           specified, standard input is read.
           This utility is a line-oriented tool and it uses in-memory
           allocated buffer for a whole wide-char line. If the input file is
           huge and without line breaks then allocating the memory for the
           file may be unsuccessful.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
           -0, --zero
               Zero termination. Use the byte '\0' as line separator.

           The rev command is part of the util-linux package which can be
           downloaded from Linux Kernel Archive
