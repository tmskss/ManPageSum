## DESCRIPTION         top
           last looks through the file wtmp (which records all
           logins/logouts) and prints information about connect times of
           users. Records are printed from most recent to least recent.
           Records can be specified by tty and username.  tty names can be
           abbreviated:
                                        last 0
           is equivalent to
                                      last tty0.
           Multiple arguments can be specified:
                                   last root console
           will print all of the entries for the user root and all entries
           logged in on the console tty.
           The special users reboot and shutdown log in when the system
           reboots or (surprise) shuts down.
                                      last reboot
           will produce a record of reboot times.
           If last is interrupted by a quit signal, it prints out how far
           its search in the wtmp file had reached and then quits.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n num, --lines num
                  Limit the number of lines that last outputs.  This is
                  different from u*x last, which lets you specify the number
                  right after a dash.
           -f filename, --file filename
                  Read from the file filename instead of the system's wtmp
                  file.
           --complain
                  When the wtmp file has a problem (a time-warp, missing
                  record, or whatever), print out an appropriate error.
           --tw-leniency num
                  Set the time warp leniency to num seconds.  Records in
                  wtmp files might be slightly out of order (most notably
                  when two logins occur within a one-second period - the
                  second one gets written first).  By default, this value is
                  set to 60.  If the program notices this problem, time is
                  not assigned to users unless the --timewarps flag is used.
           --tw-suspicious num
                  Set the time warp suspicious value to num seconds.  If two
                  records in the wtmp file are farther than this number of
                  seconds apart, there is a problem with the wtmp file (or
                  your machine hasn't been used in a year).  If the program
                  notices this problem, time is not assigned to users unless
                  the --timewarps flag is used.
           --no-truncate-ftp-entries
                  When printing out the information, don't chop the number
                  part off of `ftp'XXXX entries.
           -x, --more-records
                  Print out run level changes, shutdowns, and time changes
                  in addition to the normal records.
           -a, --all-records
                  Print out all records in the wtmp file.
           -i, --ip-address
                  Some machines store the IP address of a connection in a
                  utmp record.  Enabling this option makes last print the IP
                  address instead of the hostname.
           -w, --wide
                  By default, last tries to print each entry within in 80
                  columns.  Use this option to instruct last to print out
                  the fields in the wtmp file with full field widths.
           --debug
                  Print verbose internal information.
           -s, --print-seconds
                  Print seconds when displaying dates.
           -y, --print-year
                  Print year when displaying dates.
           -V, --version
                  Print last's version number.
           -h, --help
                  Prints the usage string and default locations of system
                  files to standard output and exits.
## FILES         top
