## NAME         top
           pmlogsize - report sizes for parts of PCP archive(s)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmlogsize [-drv?]  [-x threshold] archive [...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmlogsize prints information about the size of the index,
           metadata and data sections of a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
           archive.  The output is intended to guide improvements in archive
           encoding format for PCP developers and to help trim pmlogger(1)
           configuration files to remove metrics that are bloating the PCP
           archives with low-value data in production environments.
           The archive arguments can be any mixture of the names of the
           physical files of a PCP archive or the basename that is common to
           all the component physical files in a single archive.  In the
           latter case archive is replaced by a list of all of the matching
           component file names.
           Note the semantics is a little different to other PCP tools in
           that foo.meta means just the file foo.meta, not foo.index,
           foo.meta, foo.0, etc.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -d, --detail
                Enable detailed reporting.  This means space per instance
                domain in a metadata file and space per metric (for values)
                in a data file.
           -r, --replication
                Display additional information about possible replicated
                values in the data file and replicated instances in the
                metadata file.  This option implies -d.
           -x threshold, --threshold=threshold
                With -d (or -r), cut off the report after at least threshold
                percent of the associated space (metric values or instance
                domains) has been reported.  The default behaviour is
                equivalent to threshold being set to 100.
           -v, --verbose
                Enable verbose mode.  This option can be provided more than
                once for additional verbosity.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
