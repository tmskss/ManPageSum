    W(1)                          User Commands                         W(1)
## NAME         top
           w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           w [options] [user]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           w displays information about the users currently on the machine,
           and their processes.  The header shows, in this order, the
           current time, how long the system has been running, how many
           users are currently logged on, and the system load averages for
           the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
           The following entries are displayed for each user: login name,
           the tty name, the remote host, login time, idle time, JCPU, PCPU,
           and the command line of their current process.
           The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the
           tty.  It does not include past background jobs, but does include
           currently running background jobs.
           The PCPU time is the time used by the current process, named in
           the "what" field.
## COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS         top
           -h, --no-header
                  Don't print the header.
           -u, --no-current
                  Ignores the username while figuring out the current
                  process and cpu times.  To demonstrate this, do a su and
                  do a w and a w -u.
           -s, --short
                  Use the short format.  Don't print the login time, JCPU or
                  PCPU times.
           -f, --from
                  Toggle printing the from (remote hostname) field.  The
                  default as released is for the from field to not be
                  printed, although your system administrator or
                  distribution maintainer may have compiled a version in
                  which the from field is shown by default.
           --help Display help text and exit.
           -i, --ip-addr
                  Display IP address instead of hostname for from field.
           -p, --pids
                  Display pid of the login process/the "what" process in the
                  "what" field.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information.
           -o, --old-style
                  Old style output.  Prints blank space for idle times less
                  than one minute.
           user   Show information about the specified user only.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           PROCPS_USERLEN
                  Override the default width of the username column.
                  Defaults to 8.
           PROCPS_FROMLEN
                  Override the default width of the from column.  Defaults
                  to 16.
## FILES         top
           /var/run/utmp
                  information about who is currently logged on
           /proc  process information
