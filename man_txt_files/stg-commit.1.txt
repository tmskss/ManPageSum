## NAME         top
           stg-commit - Finalize patches to the stack base
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg commit [OPTIONS] [patch]...
           stg commit [OPTIONS] -n <number>
           stg commit [OPTIONS] --all
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Finalize one or more patches into the base of the current stack
           and remove them from the series. This is the opposite of
           stg-uncommit(1). Use this command when a patch is completed and
           no longer needs to be managed with StGit.
           By default, the bottommost patch is committed. If patch names are
           given, the stack is rearranged so that those patches are at the
           bottom, and then they are committed.
           The -n/--number option specifies the number of applied patches to
           commit (counting from the bottom of the stack). If -a/--all is
           given, all applied patches are committed.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n <number>, --number=<number>
               Commit the specified number of applied patches
           -a, --all
               Commit all applied patches
           --allow-empty
               Allow empty patches to be committed
