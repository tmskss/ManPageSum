## NAME         top
           blkrawverify - verifies an output file produced by blkparse
## SYNOPSIS         top
           blkrawverify <dev> [<dev>...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The blkrawverify utility can be used to verify data retrieved via
           blktrace. It will check for valid event formats, forward
           progressing sequence numbers and time stamps, also does
           reasonable checks for other potential issues within individual
           events.
           Errors found will be tracked in <dev>.verify.out.
## AUTHORS         top

           Scott.  This man page was created from the blktrace documentation
           by Bas Zoetekouw.
