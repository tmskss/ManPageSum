    CAL(1)                        User Commands                       CAL(1)
## NAME         top
           cal - display a calendar
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cal [options] [[[day] month] year]
           cal [options] [timestamp|monthname]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           cal displays a simple calendar. If no arguments are specified,
           the current month is displayed.
           The month may be specified as a number (1-12), as a month name or
           as an abbreviated month name according to the current locales.
           Two different calendar systems are used, Gregorian and Julian.
           These are nearly identical systems with Gregorian making a small
           adjustment to the frequency of leap years; this facilitates
           improved synchronization with solar events like the equinoxes.
           The Gregorian calendar reform was introduced in 1582, but its
           adoption continued up to 1923. By default cal uses the adoption
           date of 3 Sept 1752. From that date forward the Gregorian
           calendar is displayed; previous dates use the Julian calendar
           system. 11 days were removed at the time of adoption to bring the
           calendar in sync with solar events. So Sept 1752 has a mix of
           Julian and Gregorian dates by which the 2nd is followed by the
           14th (the 3rd through the 13th are absent).
           Optionally, either the proleptic Gregorian calendar or the Julian
           calendar may be used exclusively. See --reform below.
## OPTIONS         top
           -1, --one
               Display single month output. (This is the default.)
           -3, --three
               Display three months spanning the date.
           -n , --months number
               Display number of months, starting from the month containing
               the date.
           -S, --span
               Display months spanning the date.
           -s, --sunday
               Display Sunday as the first day of the week.
           -m, --monday
               Display Monday as the first day of the week.
           -v, --vertical
               Display using a vertical layout (aka ncal(1) mode).
           --iso
               Display the proleptic Gregorian calendar exclusively. This
               option does not affect week numbers and the first day of the
               week. See --reform below.
           -j, --julian
               Use day-of-year numbering for all calendars. These are also
               called ordinal days. Ordinal days range from 1 to 366. This
               option does not switch from the Gregorian to the Julian
               calendar system, that is controlled by the --reform option.
               Sometimes Gregorian calendars using ordinal dates are
               referred to as Julian calendars. This can be confusing due to
               the many date related conventions that use Julian in their
               name: (ordinal) julian date, julian (calendar) date,
               (astronomical) julian date, (modified) julian date, and more.
               This option is named julian, because ordinal days are
               identified as julian by the POSIX standard. However, be aware
               that cal also uses the Julian calendar system. See
               DESCRIPTION above.
           --reform val
               This option sets the adoption date of the Gregorian calendar
               reform. Calendar dates previous to reform use the Julian
               calendar system. Calendar dates after reform use the
               Gregorian calendar system. The argument val can be:
               •   1752 - sets 3 September 1752 as the reform date
                   (default). This is when the Gregorian calendar reform was
                   adopted by the British Empire.
               •   gregorian - display Gregorian calendars exclusively. This
                   special placeholder sets the reform date below the
                   smallest year that cal can use; meaning all calendar
                   output uses the Gregorian calendar system. This is called
                   the proleptic Gregorian calendar, because dates prior to
                   the calendar system’s creation use extrapolated values.
               •   iso - alias of gregorian. The ISO 8601 standard for the
                   representation of dates and times in information
                   interchange requires using the proleptic Gregorian
                   calendar.
               •   julian - display Julian calendars exclusively. This
                   special placeholder sets the reform date above the
                   largest year that cal can use; meaning all calendar
                   output uses the Julian calendar system.
                   See DESCRIPTION above.
           -y, --year
               Display a calendar for the whole year.
           -Y, --twelve
               Display a calendar for the next twelve months.
           -w, --week[=number]
               Display week numbers in the calendar (US or ISO-8601). See
               the NOTES section for more details.
           --color[=when]
               Colorize the output. The optional argument when can be auto,
               never or always. If the when argument is omitted, it defaults
               to auto. The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in
               default see the --help output. See also the COLORS section.
           -c, --columns=columns
               Number of columns to use. auto uses as many as fit the
               terminal.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## PARAMETERS         top
           Single digits-only parameter (e.g., 'cal 2020')
               Specifies the year to be displayed; note the year must be
               fully specified: cal 89 will not display a calendar for 1989.
           Single string parameter (e.g., 'cal tomorrow' or 'cal August')
               Specifies timestamp or a month name (or abbreviated name)
               according to the current locales.
               The special placeholders are accepted when parsing timestamp,
               "now" may be used to refer to the current time, "today",
               "yesterday", "tomorrow" refer to of the current day, the day
               before or the next day, respectively.
               The relative date specifications are also accepted, in this
               case "+" is evaluated to the current time plus the specified
               time span. Correspondingly, a time span that is prefixed with
               "-" is evaluated to the current time minus the specified time
               span, for example '+2days'. Instead of prefixing the time
               span with "+" or "-", it may also be suffixed with a space
               and the word "left" or "ago" (for example '1 week ago').
           Two parameters (e.g., 'cal 11 2020')
               Denote the month (1 - 12) and year.
           Three parameters (e.g., 'cal 25 11 2020')
               Denote the day (1-31), month and year, and the day will be
               highlighted if the calendar is displayed on a terminal. If no
               parameters are specified, the current month’s calendar is
               displayed.
## NOTES         top
           A year starts on January 1. The first day of the week is
           determined by the locale or the --sunday and --monday options.
           The week numbering depends on the choice of the first day of the
           week. If it is Sunday then the customary North American numbering
           is used, where 1 January is in week number 1. If it is Monday
           (-m) then the ISO 8601 standard week numbering is used, where the
           first Thursday is in week number 1.
## COLORS         top
           The output colorization is implemented by terminal-colors.d(5)
           functionality. Implicit coloring can be disabled by an empty file
              /etc/terminal-colors.d/cal.disable
           for the cal command or for all tools by
              /etc/terminal-colors.d/disable
           The user-specific $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/terminal-colors.d or
           $HOME/.config/terminal-colors.d overrides the global setting.
           Note that the output colorization may be enabled by default, and
           in this case terminal-colors.d directories do not have to exist
           yet.
           The logical color names supported by cal are:
           today
               The current day.
           weeknumber
               The number of the week.
           header
               The header of a month.
           workday
               Days that fall within the work-week.
           weekend
               Days that fall outside the work-week.
           For example:
              echo -e 'weekend 35\ntoday 1;41\nheader yellow' >
              $HOME/.config/terminal-colors.d/cal.scheme
## HISTORY         top
           A cal command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
## BUGS         top
           The default cal output uses 3 September 1752 as the Gregorian
           calendar reform date. The historical reform dates for the other
           locales, including its introduction in October 1582, are not
           implemented.
           Alternative calendars, such as the Umm al-Qura, the Solar Hijri,
           the Ge’ez, or the lunisolar Hindu, are not supported.
