## NAME         top
           more - display the contents of a file in a terminal
## SYNOPSIS         top
           more [options] file ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           more is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.
           This version is especially primitive. Users should realize that
           less(1) provides more(1) emulation plus extensive enhancements.
## OPTIONS         top
           Options are also taken from the environment variable MORE (make
           sure to precede them with a dash (-)) but command-line options
           will override those.
           -d, --silent
               Prompt with "[Press space to continue, 'q' to quit.]", and
               display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]" instead of ringing
               the bell when an illegal key is pressed.
           -l, --logical
               Do not pause after any line containing a ^L (form feed).
           -e, --exit-on-eof
               Exit on End-Of-File, enabled by default if POSIXLY_CORRECT
               environment variable is not set or if not executed on
               terminal.
           -f, --no-pause
               Count logical lines, rather than screen lines (i.e., long
               lines are not folded).
           -p, --print-over
               Do not scroll. Instead, clear the whole screen and then
               display the text. Notice that this option is switched on
               automatically if the executable is named page.
           -c, --clean-print
               Do not scroll. Instead, paint each screen from the top,
               clearing the remainder of each line as it is displayed.
           -s, --squeeze
               Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.
           -u, --plain
               Suppress underlining. This option is silently ignored as
               backwards compatibility.
           -n, --lines number
               Specify the number of lines per screenful. The number
               argument is a positive decimal integer. The --lines option
               shall override any values obtained from any other source,
               such as number of lines reported by terminal.
           -number
               A numeric option means the same as --lines option argument.
           +number
               Start displaying each file at line number.
           +/string
               The string to be searched in each file before starting to
               display it.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## COMMANDS         top
           Interactive commands for more are based on vi(1). Some commands
           may be preceded by a decimal number, called k in the descriptions
           below. In the following descriptions, ^X means control-X.
           h or ?
               Help; display a summary of these commands. If you forget all
               other commands, remember this one.
           SPACE
               Display next k lines of text. Defaults to current screen
               size.
           z
               Display next k lines of text. Defaults to current screen
               size. Argument becomes new default.
           RETURN
               Display next k lines of text. Defaults to 1. Argument becomes
               new default.
           d or ^D
               Scroll k lines. Default is current scroll size, initially 11.
               Argument becomes new default.
           q or Q or INTERRUPT
               Exit.
           s
               Skip forward k lines of text. Defaults to 1.
           f
               Skip forward k screenfuls of text. Defaults to 1.
           b or ^B
               Skip backwards k screenfuls of text. Defaults to 1. Only
               works with files, not pipes.
           '
               Go to the place where the last search started.
           =
               Display current line number.
           /pattern
               Search for kth occurrence of regular expression. Defaults to
               1.
           n
               Search for kth occurrence of last regular expression.
               Defaults to 1.
           !command or :!command
               Execute command in a subshell.
           v
               Start up an editor at current line. The editor is taken from
               the environment variable VISUAL if defined, or EDITOR if
               VISUAL is not defined, or defaults to vi(1) if neither VISUAL
               nor EDITOR is defined.
           ^L
               Redraw screen.
           :n
               Go to kth next file. Defaults to 1.
           :p
               Go to kth previous file. Defaults to 1.
           :f
               Display current file name and line number.
           .
               Repeat previous command.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           The more command respects the following environment variables, if
           they exist:
           MORE
               This variable may be set with favored options to more.
           SHELL
               Current shell in use (normally set by the shell at login
               time).
           TERM
               The terminal type used by more to get the terminal
               characteristics necessary to manipulate the screen.
           VISUAL
               The editor the user prefers. Invoked when command key v is
               pressed.
           EDITOR
               The editor of choice when VISUAL is not specified.
           POSIXLY_CORRECT
               Disable exit-on-eof (see option -e for more details).
## HISTORY         top
           The more command appeared in 3.0BSD. This man page documents more
           version 5.19 (Berkeley 6/29/88), which is currently in use in the
           Linux community. Documentation was produced using several other
           versions of the man page, and extensive inspection of the source
           code.
## AUTHORS         top

           Modified by Geoff Peck, UCB to add underlining, single spacing.
