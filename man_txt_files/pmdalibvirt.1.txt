## NAME         top
           pmdalibvirt - libvirt PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdalibvirt is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts live performance data from libvirt hypervisor and
           domains (VMs).
           See the libvirt documentation for detailed description of each
           metric.
## INSTALLATION         top
           pmdalibvirt reads an optional ini-style configuration file
               • $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt/libvirt.conf
           This file can contain in its [pmda] section overriding values for
           the following PMDA options:
               • user
               • uri
               • backing
               • oldapi
           By default, root, qemu:///system, False, and False are used as
           values for these options, respectively.
           The backing setting can be used to expand block device
           information to cover backing chains with recent libvirt versions.
           The old API setting can be used in environments where recent
           libvirt API additions are not available (e.g., RHEL 6 /
           libvirt-0.10.2) to provide some of the metrics available with the
           newer API.  Regardless of the API version, no guest agent is
           needed for the metrics.
           Note that using non-root user typically requires also libvirt
           side configuration; please refer to libvirt documentation for
           further details on this.
           Once the needed setup is ready, you can test the connection and
           install the PMDA to enable access to the names and values for the
           libvirt performance metrics.  To install, do the following as
           root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt
               # ./connect
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt
               # ./Remove
           pmdalibvirt is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt/libvirt.conf
                  configuration file for the pmdalibvirt agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt/connect
                  connection test helper using the pmdalibvirt agent
                  configuration
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt/Install
                  installation script for the pmdalibvirt agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt/Remove
                  undo installation script for the pmdalibvirt agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/libvirt.log
                  default log file for messages from the pmdalibvirt agent
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
