## NAME         top
           git-difftool - Show changes using common diff tools
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git difftool [<options>] [<commit> [<commit>]] [--] [<path>...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           git difftool is a Git command that allows you to compare and edit
           files between revisions using common diff tools. git difftool is
           a frontend to git diff and accepts the same options and
           arguments. See git-diff(1).
## OPTIONS         top
           -d, --dir-diff
               Copy the modified files to a temporary location and perform a
               directory diff on them. This mode never prompts before
               launching the diff tool.
           -y, --no-prompt
               Do not prompt before launching a diff tool.
           --prompt
               Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool. This is the
               default behaviour; the option is provided to override any
               configuration settings.
           --rotate-to=<file>
               Start showing the diff for the given path, the paths before
               it will move to end and output.
           --skip-to=<file>
               Start showing the diff for the given path, skipping all the
               paths before it.
           -t <tool>, --tool=<tool>
               Use the diff tool specified by <tool>. Valid values include
               emerge, kompare, meld, and vimdiff. Run git difftool
               --tool-help for the list of valid <tool> settings.
               If a diff tool is not specified, git difftool will use the
               configuration variable diff.tool. If the configuration
               variable diff.tool is not set, git difftool will pick a
               suitable default.
               You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting
               the configuration variable difftool.<tool>.path. For example,
               you can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting
               difftool.kdiff3.path. Otherwise, git difftool assumes the
               tool is available in PATH.
               Instead of running one of the known diff tools, git difftool
               can be customized to run an alternative program by specifying
               the command line to invoke in a configuration variable
               difftool.<tool>.cmd.
               When git difftool is invoked with this tool (either through
               the -t or --tool option or the diff.tool configuration
               variable) the configured command line will be invoked with
               the following variables available: $LOCAL is set to the name
               of the temporary file containing the contents of the diff
               pre-image and $REMOTE is set to the name of the temporary
               file containing the contents of the diff post-image.  $MERGED
               is the name of the file which is being compared.  $BASE is
               provided for compatibility with custom merge tool commands
               and has the same value as $MERGED.
           --tool-help
               Print a list of diff tools that may be used with --tool.
           --[no-]symlinks
               git difftool's default behavior is create symlinks to the
               working tree when run in --dir-diff mode and the right-hand
               side of the comparison yields the same content as the file in
               the working tree.
               Specifying --no-symlinks instructs git difftool to create
               copies instead.  --no-symlinks is the default on Windows.
           -x <command>, --extcmd=<command>
               Specify a custom command for viewing diffs.  git-difftool
               ignores the configured defaults and runs $command $LOCAL
               $REMOTE when this option is specified. Additionally, $BASE is
               set in the environment.
           -g, --[no-]gui
               When git-difftool is invoked with the -g or --gui option the
               default diff tool will be read from the configured
               diff.guitool variable instead of diff.tool. This may be
               selected automatically using the configuration variable
               difftool.guiDefault. The --no-gui option can be used to
               override these settings. If diff.guitool is not set, we will
               fallback in the order of merge.guitool, diff.tool, merge.tool
               until a tool is found.
           --[no-]trust-exit-code
               git-difftool invokes a diff tool individually on each file.
               Errors reported by the diff tool are ignored by default. Use
               --trust-exit-code to make git-difftool exit when an invoked
               diff tool returns a non-zero exit code.
               git-difftool will forward the exit code of the invoked tool
               when --trust-exit-code is used.
           See git-diff(1) for the full list of supported options.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           git difftool falls back to git mergetool config variables when
           the difftool equivalents have not been defined.
           Everything above this line in this section isn’t included from
           the git-config(1) documentation. The content that follows is the
           same as what’s found there:
           diff.tool
               Controls which diff tool is used by git-difftool(1). This
               variable overrides the value configured in merge.tool. The
               list below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value
               is treated as a custom diff tool and requires that a
               corresponding difftool.<tool>.cmd variable is defined.
           diff.guitool
               Controls which diff tool is used by git-difftool(1) when the
               -g/--gui flag is specified. This variable overrides the value
               configured in merge.guitool. The list below shows the valid
               built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom diff
               tool and requires that a corresponding difftool.<guitool>.cmd
               variable is defined.
           difftool.<tool>.cmd
               Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool. The
               specified command is evaluated in shell with the following
               variables available: LOCAL is set to the name of the
               temporary file containing the contents of the diff pre-image
               and REMOTE is set to the name of the temporary file
               containing the contents of the diff post-image.
               See the --tool=<tool> option in git-difftool(1) for more
               details.
           difftool.<tool>.path
               Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case
               your tool is not in the PATH.
           difftool.trustExitCode
               Exit difftool if the invoked diff tool returns a non-zero
               exit status.
               See the --trust-exit-code option in git-difftool(1) for more
               details.
           difftool.prompt
               Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool.
           difftool.guiDefault
               Set true to use the diff.guitool by default (equivalent to
               specifying the --gui argument), or auto to select
               diff.guitool or diff.tool depending on the presence of a
               DISPLAY environment variable value. The default is false,
               where the --gui argument must be provided explicitly for the
               diff.guitool to be used.
