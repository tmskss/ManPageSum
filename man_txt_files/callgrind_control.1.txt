## NAME         top
           callgrind_control - observe and control programs being run by
           Callgrind
## SYNOPSIS         top
           callgrind_control [options] [pid|program-name...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           callgrind_control controls programs being run by the Valgrind
           tool Callgrind. When a pid/program name argument is not
           specified, all applications currently being run by Callgrind on
           this system will be used for actions given by the specified
           option(s). The default action is to give some brief information
           about the applications being run by Callgrind.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h --help
               Show a short description, usage, and summary of options.
           --version
               Show version of callgrind_control.
           -l --long
               Show also the working directory, in addition to the brief
               information given by default.
           -s --stat
               Show statistics information about active Callgrind runs.
           -b --back
               Show stack/back traces of each thread in active Callgrind
               runs. For each active function in the stack trace, also the
               number of invocations since program start (or last dump) is
               shown. This option can be combined with -e to show inclusive
               cost of active functions.
           -e [A,B,...]  (default: all)
               Show the current per-thread, exclusive cost values of event
               counters. If no explicit event names are given, figures for
               all event types which are collected in the given Callgrind
               run are shown. Otherwise, only figures for event types A, B,
               ... are shown. If this option is combined with -b, inclusive
               cost for the functions of each active stack frame is
               provided, too.
           --dump[=<desc>]  (default: no description)
               Request the dumping of profile information. Optionally, a
               description can be specified which is written into the dump
               as part of the information giving the reason which triggered
               the dump action. This can be used to distinguish multiple
               dumps.
           -z --zero
               Zero all event counters.
           -k --kill
               Force a Callgrind run to be terminated.
           --instr=<on|off>
               Switch instrumentation mode on or off. If a Callgrind run has
               instrumentation disabled, no simulation is done and no events
               are counted. This is useful to skip uninteresting program
               parts, as there is much less slowdown (same as with the
               Valgrind tool "none"). See also the Callgrind option
               --instr-atstart.
           --vgdb-prefix=<prefix>
               Specify the vgdb prefix to use by callgrind_control.
               callgrind_control internally uses vgdb to find and control
               the active Callgrind runs. If the --vgdb-prefix option was
               used for launching valgrind, then the same option must be
               given to callgrind_control.
