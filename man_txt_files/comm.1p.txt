    COMM(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               COMM(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           comm — select or reject lines common to two files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           comm [-123] file1 file2
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The comm utility shall read file1 and file2, which should be
           ordered in the current collating sequence, and produce three text
           columns as output: lines only in file1, lines only in file2, and
           lines in both files.
           If the lines in both files are not ordered according to the
           collating sequence of the current locale, the results are
           unspecified.
           If the collating sequence of the current locale does not have a
           total ordering of all characters (see the Base Definitions volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 7.3.2, LC_COLLATE) and any lines from
           the input files collate equally but are not identical, comm
           should treat them as different lines but may treat them as being
           the same. If it treats them as different, comm should expect them
           to be ordered according to a further byte-by-byte comparison
           using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale and if they are
           not ordered in this way, the output of comm can identify such
           lines as being both unique to file1 and unique to file2 instead
           of being in both files.
## OPTIONS         top
           The comm utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -1        Suppress the output column of lines unique to file1.
           -2        Suppress the output column of lines unique to file2.
           -3        Suppress the output column of lines duplicated in file1
                     and file2.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           file1     A pathname of the first file to be compared. If file1
                     is '-', the standard input shall be used.
           file2     A pathname of the second file to be compared. If file2
                     is '-', the standard input shall be used.
           If both file1 and file2 refer to standard input or to the same
           FIFO special, block special, or character special file, the
           results are undefined.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be used only if one of the file1 or
           file2 operands refers to standard input. See the INPUT FILES
           section.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The input files shall be text files.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           comm:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_COLLATE
                     Determine the locale for the collating sequence comm
                     expects to have been used when the input files were
                     sorted.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The comm utility shall produce output depending on the options
           selected. If the -1, -2, and -3 options are all selected, comm
           shall write nothing to standard output.
           If the -1 option is not selected, lines contained only in file1
           shall be written using the format:
               "%s\n", <line in file1>
           If the -2 option is not selected, lines contained only in file2
           are written using the format:
               "%s%s\n", <lead>, <line in file2>
           where the string <lead> is as follows:
           <tab>     The -1 option is not selected.
           null string
                     The -1 option is selected.
           If the -3 option is not selected, lines contained in both files
           shall be written using the format:
               "%s%s\n", <lead>, <line in both>
           where the string <lead> is as follows:
           <tab><tab>
                     Neither the -1 nor the -2 option is selected.
           <tab>     Exactly one of the -1 and -2 options is selected.
           null string
                     Both the -1 and -2 options are selected.
           If the input files were ordered according to the collating
           sequence of the current locale, the lines written shall be in the
           collating sequence of the current locale. If the input files
           contained any lines that collated equally but were not identical
           and within each file those lines were ordered according to a
           further byte-by-byte comparison using the collating sequence for
           the POSIX locale, and comm treated them as different lines, then
           lines written that collate equally but are not identical should
           be ordered according to a further byte-by-byte comparison using
           the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    All input files were successfully output as specified.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           If the input files are not properly presorted, the output of comm
           might not be useful.
           When using comm to process pathnames, it is recommended that
           LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or
           C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences
           that do not form valid characters in some locales, in which case
           the utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX locale
           each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this
           problem is avoided.
           If the collating sequence of the current locale does not have a
           total ordering of all characters, this can affect the behavior of
           comm in the following ways:
            *  If comm treats lines as being the same only if they are
               identical, some lines can be misleadingly identified as being
               both unique to file1 and unique to file2.
            *  If comm treats lines as being the same if they collate
               equally and a line from file1 collates equally with a line
               from file2 but is not identical to it, one of the lines is
               misleadingly identified as being in both files and the other
               is not written to the output at all.
           Such problems can be avoided by forcing the use of the POSIX
           locale; for example, the following identifies lines in both file1
           and file2:
               LC_ALL=POSIX sort file1 > file1.posix
               LC_ALL=POSIX sort file2 > file2.posix
               LC_ALL=POSIX comm -12 file1.posix file2.posix | sort
           The final sort re-sorts the output of comm according to the
           collating sequence of the original locale. Doing this might be
           difficult if more than one column is output and leading <blank>s
           cannot be ignored.
## EXAMPLES         top
           If a file named xcu contains a sorted list of the utilities in
           this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, a file named xpg3 contains a sorted
           list of the utilities specified in the X/Open Portability Guide,
           Issue 3, and a file named svid89 contains a sorted list of the
           utilities in the System V Interface Definition Third Edition:
               comm -23 xcu xpg3 | comm -23 - svid89
           would print a list of utilities in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
           not specified by either of the other documents:
               comm -12 xcu xpg3 | comm -12 - svid89
           would print a list of utilities specified by all three documents,
           and:
               comm -12 xpg3 svid89 | comm -23 - xcu
           would print a list of utilities specified by both XPG3 and the
           SVID, but not specified in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           A future version of this standard may require that if any lines
           from the input files collate equally but are not identical, then
           comm treats them as different lines and expects them to be
           ordered according to a further byte-by-byte comparison using the
           collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
           A future version of this standard may require that if the input
           files contained any lines that collated equally but were not
           identical and within each file those lines were ordered according
           to a further byte-by-byte comparison using the collating sequence
           for the POSIX locale, then lines written that collate equally but
           are not identical are ordered according to a further byte-by-byte
           comparison using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
