## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           logname — return the user's login name
## SYNOPSIS         top
           logname
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The logname utility shall write the user's login name to standard
           output. The login name shall be the string that would be returned
           by the getlogin() function defined in the System Interfaces
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017. Under the conditions where the getlogin()
           function would fail, the logname utility shall write a diagnostic
           message to standard error and exit with a non-zero exit status.
## OPTIONS         top
           None.
## OPERANDS         top
           None.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           logname:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The logname utility output shall be a single line consisting of
           the user's login name:
               "%s\n", <login name>
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           The logname utility explicitly ignores the LOGNAME environment
           variable because environment changes could produce erroneous
           results.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           The passwd file is not listed as required because the
           implementation may have other means of mapping login names.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
