## DESCRIPTION         top
           ac prints out a report of connect time (in hours) based on the
           logins/logouts in the current wtmp file.  A total is also printed
           out.
           The accounting file wtmp is maintained by init(8) and login(1).
           Neither ac nor login creates the wtmp if it doesn't exist, no
           accounting is done.  To begin accounting, create the file with a
           length of zero.
           NOTE:  The wtmp file can get really big, really fast.  You might
           want to trim it every once and a while.
           GNU ac works nearly the same UNIX ac, though it's a little
           smarter in several ways.  You should therefore expect differences
           in the output of GNU ac and the output of ac's on other systems.
           Use the command info accounting to get additional information.
## OPTIONS         top
           -d, --daily-totals
                  Print totals for each day rather than just one big total
                  at the end.  The output looks like this:
                          Jul  3  total     1.17
                          Jul  4  total     2.10
                          Jul  5  total     8.23
                          Jul  6  total     2.10
                          Jul  7  total     0.30
           -p, --individual-totals
                  Print time totals for each user in addition to the usual
                  everything-lumped-into-one value.  It looks like:
                          bob       8.06
                          goff      0.60
                          maley     7.37
                          root      0.12
                          total    16.15
           people Print out the sum total of the connect time used by all of
                  the users included in people.  Note that people is a space
                  separated list of valid user names; wildcards are not
                  allowed.
           -f, --file filename
                  Read from the file filename instead of the system's wtmp
                  file.
           --complain
                  When the wtmp file has a problem (a time-warp, missing
                  record, or whatever), print out an appropriate error.
           --reboots
                  Reboot records are NOT written at the time of a reboot,
                  but when the system restarts; therefore, it is impossible
                  to know exactly when the reboot occurred.  Users may have
                  been logged into the system at the time of the reboot, and
                  many ac's automatically count the time between the login
                  and the reboot record against the user (even though all of
                  that time shouldn't be, perhaps, if the system is down for
                  a long time, for instance).  If you want to count this
                  time, include the flag.  *For vanilla ac compatibility,
                  include this flag.*
           --supplants
                  Sometimes, a logout record is not written for a specific
                  terminal, so the time that the last user accrued cannot be
                  calculated.  If you want to include the time from the
                  user's login to the next login on the terminal (though
                  probably incorrect), include this you want to include the
                  time from the user's login to the next login on the
                  terminal (though probably incorrect), include this flag.
                  *For vanilla ac compatibility, include this flag.*
           --timewarps
                  Sometimes, entries in a wtmp file will suddenly jump back
                  into the past without a clock change record occurring.  It
                  is impossible to know how long a user was logged in when
                  this occurs.  If you want to count the time between the
                  login and the time warp against the user, include this
                  flag.  *For vanilla ac compatibility, include this flag.*
           --compatibility
                  This is shorthand for typing out the three above options.
           -a, --all-days
                  If we're printing daily totals, print a record for every
                  day instead of skipping intervening days where there is no
                  login activity.  Without this flag, time accrued during
                  those intervening days gets listed under the next day
                  where there is login activity.
           --tw-leniency num
                  Set the time warp leniency to num seconds.  Records in
                  wtmp files might be slightly out of order (most notably
                  when two logins occur within a one-second period - the
                  second one gets written first).  By default, this value is
                  set to 60.  If the program notices this problem, time is
                  not assigned to users unless the --timewarps flag is used.
           --tw-suspicious num
                  Set the time warp suspicious value to num seconds.  If two
                  records in the wtmp file are farther than this number of
                  seconds apart, there is a problem with the wtmp file (or
                  your machine hasn't been used in a year).  If the program
                  notices this problem, time is not assigned to users unless
                  the --timewarps flag is used.
           -y, --print-year
                  Print year when displaying dates.
           -z, --print-zeros
                  If a total for any category (save the grand total) is
                  zero, print it.  The default is to suppress printing.
           --debug
                  Print verbose internal information.
           -V, --version
                  Print the version number of ac to standard output and
                  quit.
           -h, --help
                  Prints the usage string and default locations of system
                  files to standard output and exits.
