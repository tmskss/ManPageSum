## NAME         top
           stg-spill - Spill changes from the topmost patch
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg spill [OPTIONS] [path]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Spill changes from the topmost patch. Changes are removed from
           the patch, but remain in the index and worktree.
           Spilling a patch may be useful for reselecting the files/hunks to
           be included in the patch.
## OPTIONS         top
           -a <note>, --annotate=<note>
               Annotate the patch log entry with note
           -r, --reset
               Also reset the index such that the patch’s changes only
               remain in the worktree. Without this option, the patch’s
               changes will be in both the index and worktree.
           --committer-date-is-author-date
               Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
               the author date of the commit as the committer date.
