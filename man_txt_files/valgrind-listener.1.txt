## NAME         top
           valgrind-listener - listens on a socket for Valgrind commentary
## SYNOPSIS         top
           valgrind-listener [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           valgrind-listener accepts (multiple) connections from valgrind
           processes that use the --log-socket option on the specified port
           and copies the commentary it is sent to stdout.
## OPTIONS         top
           -e --exit-at-zero
               When the number of connected processes falls back to zero,
               exit. Without this, it will run forever, that is, until you
               send it Control-C.
           --max-connect=INTEGER
               By default, the listener can connect to up to 50 processes.
               Occasionally, that number is too small. Use this option to
               provide a different limit. E.g.  --max-connect=100.
           portnumber
               Changes the port it listens on from the default (1500). The
               specified port must be in the range 1024 to 65535. The same
               restriction applies to port numbers specified by a
               --log-socket to Valgrind itself.
