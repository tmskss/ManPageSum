## NAME         top
           git-whatchanged - Show logs with difference each commit
           introduces
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git whatchanged <option>...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.
           New users are encouraged to use git-log(1) instead. The
           whatchanged command is essentially the same as git-log(1) but
           defaults to show the raw format diff output and to skip merges.
           The command is kept primarily for historical reasons; fingers of
           many people who learned Git long before git log was invented by
           reading Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.
## EXAMPLES         top
           git whatchanged -p v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi
               Show as patches the commits since version v2.6.12 that
               changed any file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi
               subdirectories
           git whatchanged --since="2 weeks ago" -- gitk
               Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file gitk.
               The "--" is necessary to avoid confusion with the branch
               named gitk

           system) project.  Information about the project can be found at
           ⟨http://git-scm.com/⟩.  If you have a bug report for this manual
           page, see ⟨http://git-scm.com/community⟩.  This page was obtained
           from the project's upstream Git repository

           the date of the most recent commit that was found in the
           repository was 2023-06-22.)  If you discover any rendering
