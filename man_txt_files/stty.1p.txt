## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           stty — set the options for a terminal
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stty [-a|-g]
           stty operand...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The stty utility shall set or report on terminal I/O
           characteristics for the device that is its standard input.
           Without options or operands specified, it shall report the
           settings of certain characteristics, usually those that differ
           from implementation-defined defaults.  Otherwise, it shall modify
           the terminal state according to the specified operands. Detailed
           information about the modes listed in the first five groups below
           are described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
           Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface.  Operands in the
           Combination Modes group (see Combination Modes) are implemented
           using operands in the previous groups. Some combinations of
           operands are mutually-exclusive on some terminal types; the
           results of using such combinations are unspecified.
           Typical implementations of this utility require a communications
           line configured to use the termios interface defined in the
           System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017. On systems where none
           of these lines are available, and on lines not currently
           configured to support the termios interface, some of the operands
           need not affect terminal characteristics.
## OPTIONS         top
           The stty utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -a        Write to standard output all the current settings for
                     the terminal.
           -g        Write to standard output all the current settings in an
                     unspecified form that can be used as arguments to
                     another invocation of the stty utility on the same
                     system. The form used shall not contain any characters
                     that would require quoting to avoid word expansion by
                     the shell; see Section 2.6, Word Expansions.

                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  This variable determines the locale for the
                     interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
                     characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
                     multi-byte characters in arguments) and which
                     characters are in the class print.
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           If operands are specified, no output shall be produced.
           If the -g option is specified, stty shall write to standard
           output the current settings in a form that can be used as
           arguments to another instance of stty on the same system.
           If the -a option is specified, all of the information as
           described in the OPERANDS section shall be written to standard
           output. Unless otherwise specified, this information shall be
           written as <space>-separated tokens in an unspecified format, on
           one or more lines, with an unspecified number of tokens per line.
           Additional information may be written.
           If no options or operands are specified, an unspecified subset of
           the information written for the -a option shall be written.
           If speed information is written as part of the default output, or
           if the -a option is specified and if the terminal input speed and
           output speed are the same, the speed information shall be written
           as follows:
               "speed %d baud;", <speed>
           Otherwise, speeds shall be written as:
               "ispeed %d baud; ospeed %d baud;", <ispeed>, <ospeed>
           In locales other than the POSIX locale, the word baud may be
           changed to something more appropriate in those locales.
           If control characters are written as part of the default output,
           or if the -a option is specified, control characters shall be
           written as:
               "%s = %s;", <control-character name>, <value>
           where <value> is either the character, or some visual
           representation of the character if it is non-printable, or the
           string undef if the character is disabled.
## STDERR         top

## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    The terminal options were read or set successfully.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           The -g flag is designed to facilitate the saving and restoring of
           terminal state from the shell level. For example, a program may:
               saveterm="$(stty -g)"       # save terminal state
               stty (new settings)         # set new state
               ...                         # ...
               stty $saveterm              # restore terminal state
           Since the format is unspecified, the saved value is not portable
           across systems.
           Since the -a format is so loosely specified, scripts that save
           and restore terminal settings should use the -g option.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           The original stty description was taken directly from System V
           and reflected the System V terminal driver termio.  It has been
           modified to correspond to the terminal driver termios.
           Output modes are specified only for XSI-conformant systems. All
           implementations are expected to provide stty operands
           corresponding to all of the output modes they support.
           The stty utility is primarily used to tailor the user interface
           of the terminal, such as selecting the preferred ERASE and KILL
           characters. As an application programming utility, stty can be
           used within shell scripts to alter the terminal settings for the
           duration of the script.
           The termios section states that individual disabling of control
           characters is possible through the option _POSIX_VDISABLE.  If
           enabled, two conventions currently exist for specifying this:
           System V uses "^-", and BSD uses undef.  Both are accepted by
           stty in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. The other BSD convention of
           using the letter 'u' was rejected because it conflicts with the
           actual letter 'u', which is an acceptable value for a control
           character.
           Early proposals did not specify the mapping of "^c" to control
           characters because the control characters were not specified in
           the POSIX locale character set description file requirements. The
           control character set is now specified in the Base Definitions
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 3, Definitions, so the historical
           mapping is specified. Note that although the mapping corresponds
           to control-character key assignments on many terminals that use
           the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard (or ASCII) character encodings, the
           mapping specified here is to the control characters, not their
           keyboard encodings.
           Since termios supports separate speeds for input and output, two
           new options were added to specify each distinctly.
           Some historical implementations use standard input to get and set
           terminal characteristics; others use standard output. Since input
           from a login TTY is usually restricted to the owner while output
           to a TTY is frequently open to anyone, using standard input
           provides fewer chances of accidentally (or maliciously) altering
           the terminal settings of other users. Using standard input also
           allows stty -a and stty -g output to be redirected for later use.
           Therefore, usage of standard input is required by this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017.
