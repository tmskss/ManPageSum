    GETFATTR(1)                  File Utilities                  GETFATTR(1)
## NAME         top
           getfattr - get extended attributes of filesystem objects
## SYNOPSIS         top
           getfattr [-hRLP] -n name [-e en] pathname...
           getfattr [-hRLP] -d [-e en] [-m pattern] pathname...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           For each file, getfattr displays the file name, and the set of
           extended attribute names (and optionally values) which are
           associated with that file. Per default only attributes in the
           user namespace are displayed, see -m.
           The output format of getfattr -d is as follows:
                   1:  # file: somedir/
                   2:  user.name0="value0"
                   3:  user.name1="value1"
                   4:  user.name2="value2"
                   5:  ...
           Line 1 identifies the file name for which the following lines are
           being reported.  The remaining lines (lines 2 to 4 above) show
           the name and value pairs associated with the specified file.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n name, --name=name
               Dump the value of the named extended attribute.
           -d, --dump
               Dump the values of all matched extended attributes.
           -e en, --encoding=en
               Encode values after retrieving them.  Valid values of en are
               "text", "hex", and "base64".  Values encoded as text strings
               are enclosed in double quotes ("), while strings encoded as
               hexadecimal and base64 are prefixed with 0x and 0s,
               respectively.
           -h, --no-dereference
               Do not dereference symlinks. Instead of the file a symlink
               refers to, the symlink itself is examined.  Unless doing a
               logical (-L) traversal, do not traverse symlinks to
               directories.
           -m pattern, --match=pattern
               Only include attributes with names matching the regular
               expression pattern.  The default value for pattern is
               "^user\\.", which includes all the attributes in the user
               namespace. Specify "-" for including all attributes.  Refer
               to xattr(7) for a more detailed discussion of namespaces.
           --absolute-names
               Do not strip leading slash characters ('/').  The default
               behaviour is to strip leading slash characters.
           --only-values
               Dump out the raw extended attribute value(s) without encoding
               them.
           -R, --recursive
               List the attributes of all files and directories recursively.
           -L, --logical
               Logical walk, follow symbolic links to directories.  The
               default behaviour is to follow symbolic link arguments unless
               --no-dereference is given, and to skip symbolic links
               encountered in subdirectories.  Only effective in combination
               with -R.
           -P, --physical
               Physical walk, do not follow symbolic links to directories.
               This also skips symbolic link arguments.  Only effective in
               combination with -R.
           --version
               Print the version of getfattr and exit.
           --help
               Print help explaining the command line options.
           --  End of command line options.  All remaining parameters are
               interpreted as file names, even if they start with a dash
               character.
