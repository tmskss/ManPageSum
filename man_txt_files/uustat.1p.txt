    UUSTAT(1P)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             UUSTAT(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           uustat — uucp status enquiry and job control
## SYNOPSIS         top
           uustat [-q|-k jobid|-r jobid]
           uustat [-s system] [-u user]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The uustat utility shall display the status of, or cancel,
           previously specified uucp requests, or provide general status on
           uucp connections to other systems.
           When no options are given, uustat shall write to standard output
           the status of all uucp requests issued by the current user.
           Typical implementations of this utility require a communications
           line configured to use the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface, but other
           communications means may be used. On systems where there are no
           available communications means (either temporarily or
           permanently), this utility shall write an error message
           describing the problem and exit with a non-zero exit status.
## OPTIONS         top
           The uustat utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -q        Write the jobs queued for each machine.
           -k jobid  Kill the uucp request whose job identification is
                     jobid.  The application shall ensure that the killed
                     uucp request belongs to the person invoking uustat
                     unless that user has appropriate privileges.
           -r jobid  Rejuvenate jobid.  The files associated with jobid are
                     touched so that their modification time is set to the
                     current time. This prevents the cleanup program from
                     deleting the job until the jobs modification time
                     reaches the limit imposed by the program.
           -s system Write the status of all uucp requests for remote system
                     system.
           -u user   Write the status of all uucp requests issued by user.
## OPERANDS         top
           None.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           uustat:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error, and informative messages written to
                     standard output.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The standard output shall consist of information about each job
           selected, in an unspecified format. The information shall include
           at least the job ID, the user ID or name, and the remote system
           name.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           This utility is part of the UUCP Utilities option and need not be
           supported by all implementations.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
