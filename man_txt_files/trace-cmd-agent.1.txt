## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-agent - Run as an agent on a machine (to be controlled
           by another machine)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd agent [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) agent listens over a vsocket (for virtual
           machines) or a TCP port for connections to control the tracing of
           the machine. The agent will then start tracing on the local
           machine and pass the data to the controlling connection.
## OPTIONS         top
           -N client
               Listen over TCP instead of a vsocket. Must pass in a client
               host name or IP address to allow connection to. It will only
               connect to the specified client. Note, any process on that
               client can control the agent.
                   *This is a very insecure setting. Only use on a trusted network*
                   *Only use if the client machine is totally trusted*
           -p port
               This option will specify the port to listen to.
           -D
               This options causes trace-cmd agent to go into a daemon mode
               and run in the background.
           -P cid
               Allow an agent to also act as a proxy server, where it can be
               run on a host and connect with a guest.  cid is the context
               ID (see vsock(7)) of the client (e.g., guest VM) it will
               allow to connect.
           --verbose[=level]
               Set the log level. Supported log levels are "none",
               "critical", "error", "warning", "info", "debug", "all" or
               their identifiers "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6". Setting
               the log level to specific value enables all logs from that
               and all previous levels. The level will default to "info" if
               one is not specified.
                   Example: enable all critical, error and warning logs
                   trace-cmd listen --verbose=warning
