## NAME         top
           pmdazfs - ZFS filesystem performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
           for Linux
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/linux_zfs/pmdazfs [-d domain] [-l logfile]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdazfs is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts performance metrics describing the state of the ZFS
           filesystem from the stats files located in /proc.
           The zfs PMDA exports metrics that measure information about
           caching (ARC, L2ARC, ZIL, VDEV), buffering, RAIDZ, dnode
           operations and pools IO.
           A brief description of the pmdazfs command line options follows:
           -d   The performance metrics domain number must be set to a
                unique value.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                zfs.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
                pmdazfs is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
                file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
                to the standard error instead.
## INSTALLATION         top
           OpenZFS is not included in PCP, and has to be installed on the
           system from the available packages or source.  Once OpenZFS is
           installed and configured, the stats files should appear in /proc
           and PMDA can be added to PMCD using the Install script:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zfs
                # ./Install
           To remove PMDA use the Remove script:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zfs
                # ./Remove
