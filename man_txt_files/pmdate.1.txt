## NAME         top
           pmdate - display an offset date
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmdate [offset ...]  format
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdate displays the current date and/or time, with an optional
           offset.
           An offset is specified with a leading sign (``+'' or ``-''),
           followed by an integer value, followed by one of the following
           ``scale'' specifiers;
           S      seconds
           M      minutes
           H      hours
           d      days
           m      months
           y      years
           The output format follows the same rules as for date(1) and
           strftime(3).
           For example, the following will display the date a week ago as
           DDMMYYYY;
                   pmdate -7d %d%m%Y
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
           date(1), strftime(3), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).
