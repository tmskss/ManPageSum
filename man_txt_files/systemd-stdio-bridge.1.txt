## NAME         top
           systemd-stdio-bridge - D-Bus proxy
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-stdio-bridge [OPTIONS...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           systemd-stdio-bridge implements a proxy between STDIN/STDOUT and
           a D-Bus bus. It expects to receive an open connection via
           STDIN/STDOUT when started, and will create a new connection to
           the specified bus. It will then forward messages between the two
           connections. This program is suitable for socket activation: the
           first connection may be a pipe or a socket and must be passed as
           either standard input, or as an open file descriptor according to
           the protocol described in sd_listen_fds(3). The second connection
           will be made by default to the local system bus, but this can be
           influenced by the --user, --system, --machine=, and --bus-path=
           options described below.
           sd-bus(3) uses systemd-stdio-bridge to forward D-Bus connections
           over ssh(1), or to connect to the bus of a different user, see
           sd_bus_set_address(3).
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           --user
               Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than
               the service manager of the system.
           --system
               Talk to the service manager of the system. This is the
               implied default.
           -M, --machine=
               Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
               name to connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to
               connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special
               string ".host" is used in place of the container name, a
               connection to the local system is made (which is useful to
               connect to a specific user's user bus: "--user
               --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
               connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used
               either the left hand side or the right hand side may be
               omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and
               ".host" are implied.
           -p PATH, --bus-path=PATH
               Path to the bus address. Default:
               "unix:path=/run/dbus/system_bus_socket"
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
