## NAME         top
           pmdaoracle - Oracle database PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdaoracle is a Performance Co-Pilot PMDA which extracts live
           performance data from a running Oracle database.
## INSTALLATION         top
           pmdaoracle uses a configuration file from (in this order):
           •   /etc/pcpdbi.conf
           •   $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle/oracle.conf
           •   ./oracle.conf
           This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the
           settings listed at the start of pmdaoracle.pl, for example:
           •   $username - username to connect to the database [default:
               'SYSTEM']
           •   $password - password to connect to the database [default:
               'manager']
           •   $host - host the database is running on [default:
               'localhost']
           •   $port - port the database is listening on [default: '1521']
           •   $os_user - operating system username (PMDA will run with the
               corresponding user id) [default: oracle]
           •   @sids - an array of $ORACLE_SID database identifiers
               [default: ('master')]
           In order to test your local settings, a simple script is provided
           that will connect and disconnect from the database - verifying
           fundamental configuration is in place before continuing on.  If
           the $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle/connect.pl script cannot connect, do
           not proceed with installation of the PMDA as it will be
           unsuccessful.  Correct your local settings first.
           Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
           oracle performance metrics by doing the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle
               # ./Remove
           pmdaoracle is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## CONNECTION STATE         top
           By default, pmdaoracle will aggressively attempt to maintain
           persistent connections to Oracle to ensure timely responses to
           its queries, and will automatically re-connect if a connection
           drops.
           However, in certain circumstances this may be undesirable, so a
           manual pmStore(3) mechanism is provided to explicitly control
           disconnecting and reconnecting to an Oracle instance.  This can
           be used, for example, to ensure that pmdaoracle is not connected
           at shutdown, to ensure a clean Oracle shutdown process.
           The pmstore(1) command can be used to disconnect and reconnect.
           Using the individual instances of the oracle.control.connected
           metric, one can set the connection state to either up (1) or down
           (0).  Additionally, pminfo(1) can report on the current status of
           Oracle connections.
                # pminfo ‐f oracle.control.connected
                oracle.control.connected
                    inst [0 or "master"] value 1
                # pmstore oracle.control.connected 0
                oracle.control.connected inst [0 or "master"] old value=1 new value=0

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
