## NAME         top
           unshare - run program in new namespaces
## SYNOPSIS         top
           unshare [options] [program [arguments]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The unshare command creates new namespaces (as specified by the
           command-line options described below) and then executes the
           specified program. If program is not given, then "${SHELL}" is
           run (default: /bin/sh).
           By default, a new namespace persists only as long as it has
           member processes. A new namespace can be made persistent even
           when it has no member processes by bind mounting
           /proc/pid/ns/type files to a filesystem path. A namespace that
           has been made persistent in this way can subsequently be entered
           with nsenter(1) even after the program terminates (except PID
           namespaces where a permanently running init process is required).
           Once a persistent namespace is no longer needed, it can be
           unpersisted by using umount(8) to remove the bind mount. See the
           EXAMPLES section for more details.
           unshare since util-linux version 2.36 uses
           /proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children and
           /proc/[pid]/ns/time_for_children files for persistent PID and
           TIME namespaces. This change requires Linux kernel 4.17 or newer.
           The following types of namespaces can be created with unshare:
           mount namespace
               Mounting and unmounting filesystems will not affect the rest
               of the system, except for filesystems which are explicitly
               marked as shared (with mount --make-shared; see
               /proc/self/mountinfo or findmnt -o+PROPAGATION for the shared
               flags). For further details, see mount_namespaces(7).
               unshare since util-linux version 2.27 automatically sets
               propagation to private in a new mount namespace to make sure
               that the new namespace is really unshared. It’s possible to
               disable this feature with option --propagation unchanged.
               Note that private is the kernel default.
           UTS namespace
               Setting hostname or domainname will not affect the rest of
               the system. For further details, see uts_namespaces(7).
           IPC namespace
               The process will have an independent namespace for POSIX
               message queues as well as System V message queues, semaphore
               sets and shared memory segments. For further details, see
               ipc_namespaces(7).
           network namespace
               The process will have independent IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, IP
               routing tables, firewall rules, the /proc/net and
               /sys/class/net directory trees, sockets, etc. For further
               details, see network_namespaces(7).
           PID namespace
               Children will have a distinct set of PID-to-process mappings
               from their parent. For further details, see
               pid_namespaces(7).
           cgroup namespace
               The process will have a virtualized view of
               /proc/self/cgroup, and new cgroup mounts will be rooted at
               the namespace cgroup root. For further details, see
               cgroup_namespaces(7).
           user namespace
               The process will have a distinct set of UIDs, GIDs and
               capabilities. For further details, see user_namespaces(7).
           time namespace
               The process can have a distinct view of CLOCK_MONOTONIC
               and/or CLOCK_BOOTTIME which can be changed using
               /proc/self/timens_offsets. For further details, see
               time_namespaces(7).
## OPTIONS         top
           -i, --ipc[=file]
               Create a new IPC namespace. If file is specified, then the
               namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
               file.
           -m, --mount[=file]
               Create a new mount namespace. If file is specified, then the
               namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
               file. Note that file must be located on a mount whose
               propagation type is not shared (or an error results). Use the
               command findmnt -o+PROPAGATION when not sure about the
               current setting. See also the examples below.
           -n, --net[=file]
               Create a new network namespace. If file is specified, then
               the namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
               file.
           -p, --pid[=file]
               Create a new PID namespace. If file is specified, then the
               namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
               file. (Creation of a persistent PID namespace will fail if
               the --fork option is not also specified.)
               See also the --fork and --mount-proc options.
           -u, --uts[=file]
               Create a new UTS namespace. If file is specified, then the
               namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
               file.
           -U, --user[=file]
               Create a new user namespace. If file is specified, then the
               namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
               file.
           -C, --cgroup[=file]
               Create a new cgroup namespace. If file is specified, then the
               namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
               file.
           -T, --time[=file]
               Create a new time namespace. If file is specified, then the
               namespace is made persistent by creating a bind mount at
               file. The --monotonic and --boottime options can be used to
               specify the corresponding offset in the time namespace.
           -f, --fork
               Fork the specified program as a child process of unshare
               rather than running it directly. This is useful when creating
               a new PID namespace. Note that when unshare is waiting for
               the child process, then it ignores SIGINT and SIGTERM and
               does not forward any signals to the child. It is necessary to
               send signals to the child process.
           --keep-caps
               When the --user option is given, ensure that capabilities
               granted in the user namespace are preserved in the child
               process.
           --kill-child[=signame]
               When unshare terminates, have signame be sent to the forked
               child process. Combined with --pid this allows for an easy
               and reliable killing of the entire process tree below
               unshare. If not given, signame defaults to SIGKILL. This
               option implies --fork.
           --mount-proc[=mountpoint]
               Just before running the program, mount the proc filesystem at
               mountpoint (default is /proc). This is useful when creating a
               new PID namespace. It also implies creating a new mount
               namespace since the /proc mount would otherwise mess up
               existing programs on the system. The new proc filesystem is
               explicitly mounted as private (with MS_PRIVATE|MS_REC).
           --map-user=uid|name
               Run the program only after the current effective user ID has
               been mapped to uid. If this option is specified multiple
               times, the last occurrence takes precedence. This option
               implies --user.
           --map-users=inneruid:outeruid:count|auto
               Run the program only after the block of user IDs of size
               count beginning at outeruid has been mapped to the block of
               user IDs beginning at inneruid. This mapping is created with
               newuidmap(1). If the range of user IDs overlaps with the
               mapping specified by --map-user, then a "hole" will be
               removed from the mapping. This may result in the highest user
               ID of the mapping not being mapped. The special value auto
               will map the first block of user IDs owned by the effective
               user from /etc/subuid to a block starting at user ID 0. If
               this option is specified multiple times, the last occurrence
               takes precedence. This option implies --user.
               Before util-linux version 2.39, this option expected a
               comma-separated argument of the form outeruid,inneruid,count
               but that format is now deprecated for consistency with the
               ordering used in /proc/[pid]/uid_map and the X-mount.idmap
               mount option.
           --map-group=gid|name
               Run the program only after the current effective group ID has
               been mapped to gid. If this option is specified multiple
               times, the last occurrence takes precedence. This option
               implies --setgroups=deny and --user.
           --map-groups=innergid:outergid:count|auto
               Run the program only after the block of group IDs of size
               count beginning at outergid has been mapped to the block of
               group IDs beginning at innergid. This mapping is created with
               newgidmap(1). If the range of group IDs overlaps with the
               mapping specified by --map-group, then a "hole" will be
               removed from the mapping. This may result in the highest
               group ID of the mapping not being mapped. The special value
               auto will map the first block of user IDs owned by the
               effective user from /etc/subgid to a block starting at group
               ID 0. If this option is specified multiple times, the last
               occurrence takes precedence. This option implies --user.
               Before util-linux version 2.39, this option expected a
               comma-separated argument of the form outergid,innergid,count
               but that format is now deprecated for consistency with the
               ordering used in /proc/[pid]/gid_map and the X-mount.idmap
               mount option.
           --map-auto
               Map the first block of user IDs owned by the effective user
               from /etc/subuid to a block starting at user ID 0. In the
               same manner, also map the first block of group IDs owned by
               the effective group from /etc/subgid to a block starting at
               group ID 0. This option is intended to handle the common case
               where the first block of subordinate user and group IDs can
               map the whole user and group ID space. This option is
               equivalent to specifying --map-users=auto and
               --map-groups=auto.
           -r, --map-root-user
               Run the program only after the current effective user and
               group IDs have been mapped to the superuser UID and GID in
               the newly created user namespace. This makes it possible to
               conveniently gain capabilities needed to manage various
               aspects of the newly created namespaces (such as configuring
               interfaces in the network namespace or mounting filesystems
               in the mount namespace) even when run unprivileged. As a mere
               convenience feature, it does not support more sophisticated
               use cases, such as mapping multiple ranges of UIDs and GIDs.
               This option implies --setgroups=deny and --user. This option
               is equivalent to --map-user=0 --map-group=0.
           -c, --map-current-user
               Run the program only after the current effective user and
               group IDs have been mapped to the same UID and GID in the
               newly created user namespace. This option implies
               --setgroups=deny and --user. This option is equivalent to
               --map-user=$(id -ru) --map-group=$(id -rg).
           --propagation private|shared|slave|unchanged
               Recursively set the mount propagation flag in the new mount
               namespace. The default is to set the propagation to private.
               It is possible to disable this feature with the argument
               unchanged. The option is silently ignored when the mount
               namespace (--mount) is not requested.
           --setgroups allow|deny
               Allow or deny the setgroups(2) system call in a user
               namespace.
               To be able to call setgroups(2), the calling process must at
               least have CAP_SETGID. But since Linux 3.19 a further
               restriction applies: the kernel gives permission to call
               setgroups(2) only after the GID map (/proc/pid*/gid_map*) has
               been set. The GID map is writable by root when setgroups(2)
               is enabled (i.e., allow, the default), and the GID map
               becomes writable by unprivileged processes when setgroups(2)
               is permanently disabled (with deny).
           -R, --root=dir
               run the command with root directory set to dir.
           -w, --wd=dir
               change working directory to dir.
           -S, --setuid uid
               Set the user ID which will be used in the entered namespace.
           -G, --setgid gid
               Set the group ID which will be used in the entered namespace
               and drop supplementary groups.
           --monotonic offset
               Set the offset of CLOCK_MONOTONIC which will be used in the
               entered time namespace. This option requires unsharing a time
               namespace with --time.
           --boottime offset
               Set the offset of CLOCK_BOOTTIME which will be used in the
               entered time namespace. This option requires unsharing a time
               namespace with --time.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## NOTES         top
           The proc and sysfs filesystems mounting as root in a user
           namespace have to be restricted so that a less privileged user
           cannot get more access to sensitive files that a more privileged
           user made unavailable. In short the rule for proc and sysfs is as
           close to a bind mount as possible.
## EXAMPLES         top
           The following command creates a PID namespace, using --fork to
           ensure that the executed command is performed in a child process
           that (being the first process in the namespace) has PID 1. The
           --mount-proc option ensures that a new mount namespace is also
           simultaneously created and that a new proc(5) filesystem is
           mounted that contains information corresponding to the new PID
           namespace. When the readlink(1) command terminates, the new
           namespaces are automatically torn down.
               # unshare --fork --pid --mount-proc readlink /proc/self
               1
           As an unprivileged user, create a new user namespace where the
           user’s credentials are mapped to the root IDs inside the
           namespace:
               $ id -u; id -g
               1000
               1000
               $ unshare --user --map-root-user \
                       sh -c 'whoami; cat /proc/self/uid_map /proc/self/gid_map'
               root
                        0       1000          1
                        0       1000          1
           As an unprivileged user, create a user namespace where the first
           65536 IDs are all mapped, and the user’s credentials are mapped
           to the root IDs inside the namespace. The map is determined by
           the subordinate IDs assigned in subuid(5) and subgid(5).
           Demonstrate this mapping by creating a file with user ID 1 and
           group ID 1. For brevity, only the user ID mappings are shown:
               $ id -u
               1000
               $ cat /etc/subuid
               1000:100000:65536
               $ unshare --user --map-auto --map-root-user
               # id -u
               0
               # cat /proc/self/uid_map
                        0       1000          1
                        1     100000      65535
               # touch file; chown 1:1 file
               # ls -ln --time-style=+ file
               -rw-r--r-- 1 1 1 0  file
               # exit
               $ ls -ln --time-style=+ file
               -rw-r--r-- 1 100000 100000 0  file
           The first of the following commands creates a new persistent UTS
           namespace and modifies the hostname as seen in that namespace.
           The namespace is then entered with nsenter(1) in order to display
           the modified hostname; this step demonstrates that the UTS
           namespace continues to exist even though the namespace had no
           member processes after the unshare command terminated. The
           namespace is then destroyed by removing the bind mount.
               # touch /root/uts-ns
               # unshare --uts=/root/uts-ns hostname FOO
               # nsenter --uts=/root/uts-ns hostname
               FOO
               # umount /root/uts-ns
           The following commands establish a persistent mount namespace
           referenced by the bind mount /root/namespaces/mnt. In order to
           ensure that the creation of that bind mount succeeds, the parent
           directory (/root/namespaces) is made a bind mount whose
           propagation type is not shared.
               # mount --bind /root/namespaces /root/namespaces
               # mount --make-private /root/namespaces
               # touch /root/namespaces/mnt
               # unshare --mount=/root/namespaces/mnt
           The following commands demonstrate the use of the --kill-child
           option when creating a PID namespace, in order to ensure that
           when unshare is killed, all of the processes within the PID
           namespace are killed.
               # set +m                # Don't print job status messages
               # unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc --kill-child -- \
                      bash --norc -c '(sleep 555 &) && (ps a &) && sleep 999' &
               [1] 53456
               #     PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
                     1 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 999
                     3 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 555
                     5 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps a
               # ps h -o 'comm' $! # Show that background job is unshare(1)
               unshare
               # kill $! # Kill unshare(1)
               # pidof sleep
           The pidof(1) command prints no output, because the sleep
           processes have been killed. More precisely, when the sleep
           process that has PID 1 in the namespace (i.e., the namespace’s
           init process) was killed, this caused all other processes in the
           namespace to be killed. By contrast, a similar series of commands
           where the --kill-child option is not used shows that when unshare
           terminates, the processes in the PID namespace are not killed:
               # unshare --pid --fork --mount-proc -- \
                      bash --norc -c '(sleep 555 &) && (ps a &) && sleep 999' &
               [1] 53479
               #     PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
                     1 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 999
                     3 pts/3    S+     0:00 sleep 555
                     5 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps a
               # kill $!
               # pidof sleep
               53482 53480
           The following example demonstrates the creation of a time
           namespace where the boottime clock is set to a point several
           years in the past:
               # uptime -p             # Show uptime in initial time namespace
               up 21 hours, 30 minutes
               # unshare --time --fork --boottime 300000000 uptime -p
               up 9 years, 28 weeks, 1 day, 2 hours, 50 minutes
