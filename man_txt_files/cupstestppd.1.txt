## NAME         top
           cupstestppd - test conformance of ppd files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cupstestppd [ -I category ] [ -R rootdir ] [ -W category ] [ -q ]
           [ -r ] [ -v[v] ] filename.ppd[.gz] [ ...  filename.ppd[.gz] ]

           ] -
## DESCRIPTION         top
           cupstestppd tests the conformance of PPD files to the Adobe
           PostScript Printer Description file format specification version
           4.3.  It can also be used to list the supported options and
           available fonts in a PPD file.  The results of testing and any
           other output are sent to the standard output.
           The first form of cupstestppd tests one or more PPD files on the
           command-line.  The second form tests the PPD file provided on the
           standard input.
## OPTIONS         top
           cupstestppd supports the following options:
           -I filename
                Ignores all PCFileName warnings.
           -I filters
                Ignores all filter errors.
           -I profiles
                Ignores all profile errors.
           -R rootdir
                Specifies an alternate root directory for the filter, pre-
                filter, and other support file checks.
           -W constraints
                Report all UIConstraint errors as warnings.
           -W defaults
                Except for size-related options, report all default option
                errors as warnings.
           -W filters
                Report all filter errors as warnings.
           -W profiles
                Report all profile errors as warnings.
           -W sizes
                Report all media size errors as warnings.
           -W translations
                Report all translation errors as warnings.
           -W all
                Report all of the previous errors as warnings.
           -W none
                Report all of the previous errors as errors.
           -q   Specifies that no information should be displayed.
           -r   Relaxes the PPD conformance requirements so that common
                whitespace, control character, and formatting problems are
                not treated as hard errors.
           -v   Specifies that detailed conformance testing results should
                be displayed rather than the concise PASS/FAIL/ERROR status.
           -vv  Specifies that all information in the PPD file should be
                displayed in addition to the detailed conformance testing
                results.
           The -q, -v, and -vv options are mutually exclusive.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           cupstestppd returns zero on success and non-zero on error.  The
           error codes are as follows:
           1    Bad command-line arguments or missing PPD filename.
           2    Unable to open or read PPD file.
           3    The PPD file contains format errors that cannot be skipped.
           4    The PPD file does not conform to the Adobe PPD
                specification.
## EXAMPLES         top
           The following command will test all PPD files under the current
           directory and print the names of each file that does not conform:
               find . -name \*.ppd \! -exec cupstestppd -q '{}' \; -print
           The next command tests all PPD files under the current directory
           and print detailed conformance testing results for the files that
           do not conform:
               find . -name \*.ppd \! -exec cupstestppd -q '{}' \; \
                   -exec cupstestppd -v '{}' \;
## NOTES         top
           PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a
           future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP
           can be supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
