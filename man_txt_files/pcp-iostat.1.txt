## NAME         top
           pmiostat, pcp-iostat - report block I/O statistics
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] iostat [-u?]  [-G method] [-P precision] [-R
           pattern] [-x [dm][,t][,h][,noidle]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-iostat reports I/O statistics for SCSI (by default) or other
           devices (if the -x option is specified).
## OPTIONS         top
           When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the pcp options -A/--align,
           -a/--archive, -h/--host, -O/--origin, -S/--start, -s/--samples,
           -T/--finish, -t/--interval, -v/--version, -Z/--timezone and
           -z/--hostzone become indirectly available; refer to PCPIntro(1)
           for a complete description of these options.
           The additional command line options available for pcp-iostat are:
           -G method, --aggregate=method
                Specifies that statistics for device names matching the
                regular expression specified with the -R regex option should
                be aggregated according to method.  Note this is aggregation
                based on matching device names (not temporal aggregation).
                When -G is used, the device name column is reported as
                method(regex), e.g.  if -G sum -R 'sd(a|b)$' is specified,
                the device column will be sum(sd(a|b)$) and summed
                statistics for sda and sdb will be reported in the remaining
                columns.  If -G is specified but -R is not specified, then
                the default regex is .*, i.e. matching all device names.  If
                method is sum then the statistics are summed.  This includes
                the %util column, which may therefore exceed 100% if more
                than one device name matches.  If method is avg then the
                statistics are summed and then averaged by dividing by the
                number of matching device names.  If method is min or max,
                the minimum or maximum statistics for matching devices are
                reported, respectively.
           -P N, --precision=N
                This indicates the precision (number of decimal places) to
                report.  The default precision N may be set to something
                other than the default (2).  Note that the avgrq-sz and
                avgqu-sz fields are always reported with N+1 decimals of
                precision.  These fields typically have values less than 1.
           -R pattern, --regex=pattern
                This restricts the report to device names matching a regular
                expression pattern.  The given pattern is searched as a perl
                style regular expression, and will match any portion of a
                device name.  e.g. '^sd[a-zA-Z]+' will match all device
                names starting with 'sd' followed by one or more alphabetic
                characters.  e.g. '^sd(a|b)$' will only match 'sda' and
                'sdb'.  e.g. 'sda$' will match 'sda' but not 'sdab'.  See
                also the -G option for aggregation options.
           -u, --no-interpolation
                When replaying a set of archives, by default values are
                reported according to the requested sample interval (-t
                option), not according to the actual interval recorded in
                the archive(s).  Without this option PCP interpolates the
                values to be reported based on the records in the set of
                archives, which is particularly useful when the -t option is
                used to replay a set of archives with a longer sampling
                interval than that with which the archive(s) was originally
                recorded with.  With the -u option, uninterpolated reporting
                is enabled - every value is reported according to the native
                recording interval in the set of archives.  When the -u
                option is specified, the -t option makes no sense and is
                incompatible because the replay interval is always the same
                as the recording interval in the set of archive.  In
                addition, -u only makes sense when replaying archives, see
                the -a option on PCPIntro(1), and so if -u is specified then
                -a must also be specified.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -x comma-separated-options
                Specifies a comma-separated list of one or more extended
                reporting options as follows:
                dm - report statistics for device-mapper logical devices
                instead of SCSI devices,
                t - prefix every line in the report with a timestamp in
                ctime(3) format,
                h - omit the heading, which is otherwise reported every 24
                samples,
                noidle - Do not display statistics for idle devices.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## REPORT         top
           The columns in the pcp-iostat report have the following
           interpretation:
           Timestamp
                  When the -x t option is specified, this column is the
                  timestamp in ctime(3) format.
           Device Specifies the scsi device name, or if -x dm is specified,
                  the device-mapper logical device name.  When -G is
                  specified, this is replaced by the aggregation method and
                  regular expression - see the -G and -R options above.
           rrqm/s The number of read requests expressed as a rate per-second
                  that were merged during the reporting interval by the I/O
                  scheduler.
           wrqm/s The number of write requests expressed as a rate per-
                  second that were merged during the reporting interval by
                  the I/O scheduler.
           r/s    The number of read requests completed by the device (after
                  merges), expressed as a rate per second during the
                  reporting interval.
           w/s    The number of write requests completed by the device
                  (after merges), expressed as a rate per second during the
                  reporting interval.
           rkB/s  The average volume of data read from the device expressed
                  as KBytes/second during the reporting interval.
           wkB/s  The average volume of data written to the device expressed
                  as KBytes/second during the reporting interval.
           avgrq-sz
                  The average I/O request size for both reads and writes to
                  the device expressed as Kbytes during the reporting
                  interval.
           avgqu-sz
                  The average queue length of read and write requests to the
                  device during the reporting interval.
           await  The average time in milliseconds that read and write
                  requests were queued (and serviced) to the device during
                  the reporting interval.
           r_await
                  The average time in milliseconds that read requests were
                  queued (and serviced) to the device during the reporting
                  interval.
           w_await
                  The average time in milliseconds that write requests were
                  queued (and serviced) to the device during the reporting
                  interval.
           %util  The percentage of time during the reporting interval that
                  the device was busy processing requests.  A value of 100%
                  indicates device saturation.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
