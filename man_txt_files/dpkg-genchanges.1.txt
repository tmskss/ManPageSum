## NAME         top
           dpkg-genchanges - generate Debian .changes files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dpkg-genchanges [option...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dpkg-genchanges reads information from an unpacked and built
           Debian source tree and from the files it has generated and
           generates a Debian upload control file (.changes file).
## OPTIONS         top
           --build=type
               Specifies the build type from a comma-separated list of
               components (since dpkg 1.18.5).
               The allowed values are:
               source
                   Upload the source package.
               any Upload the architecture specific binary packages.
               all Upload the architecture independent binary packages.
               binary
                   Upload the architecture specific and independent binary
                   packages.  This is an alias for any,all.
               full
                   Upload everything.  This is alias for source,any,all, and
                   the same as the default case when no build option is
                   specified.
           -g  Equivalent to --build=source,all (since dpkg 1.17.11).
           -G  Equivalent to --build=source,any (since dpkg 1.17.11).
           -b  Equivalent to --build=binary or --build=any,all.
           -B  Equivalent to --build=any.
           -A  Equivalent to --build=all.
           -S  Equivalent to --build=source.
           The -sx options control whether the original source archive is
           included in the upload if any source is being generated (i.e.  -b
           or -B haven't been used).
           -si By default, or if specified, the original source will be
               included only if the upstream version number (the version
               without epoch and without Debian revision) differs from the
               upstream version number of the previous changelog entry.
           -sa Forces the inclusion of the original source.
           -sd Forces the exclusion of the original source and includes only
               the diff.
           -vversion
               Causes changelog information from all versions strictly later
               than version to be used.
           -Cchanges-description
               Read the description of the changes from the file changes-
               description rather than using the information from the source
               tree's changelog file.
           -mmaintainer-address
               Use maintainer-address as the name and email address of the
               maintainer for this package, rather than using the
               information from the source tree's control file.
           -emaintainer-address
               Use maintainer-address as the name and email address of the
               maintainer for this upload, rather than using the information
               from the source tree's changelog.
           -Vname=value
               Set an output substitution variable.  See deb-substvars(5)
               for a discussion of output substitution.
           -Tsubstvars-file
               Read substitution variables in substvars-file; the default is
               debian/substvars.  No variable substitution is done on any of
               the fields that are output, except for the contents extracted
               from each binary package Description field (since dpkg
               1.19.0), however the special variable Format will override
               the field of the same name.  This option can be used multiple
               times to read substitution variables from multiple files
               (since dpkg 1.15.6).
           -Dfield=value
               Override or add an output control file field.
           -Ufield
               Remove an output control file field.
           -ccontrolfile
               Specifies the main source control file to read information
               from. The default is debian/control.
           -lchangelog-file
               Specifies the changelog file to read information from. The
               default is debian/changelog.
           -ffiles-list-file
               Read the list of files to be uploaded here, rather than using
               debian/files.
           -Fchangelog-format
               Specifies the format of the changelog. See
               dpkg-parsechangelog(1) for information about alternative
               formats.
           -uupload-files-dir
               Look for the files to be uploaded in upload-files-dir rather
               than ..  (dpkg-genchanges needs to find these files so that
               it can include their sizes and checksums in the .changes
               file).
           -q  Usually dpkg-genchanges will produce informative messages on
               standard error, for example about how many of the package's
               source files are being uploaded.  -q suppresses these
               messages.
           -O[filename]
               Print the changes file to standard output (the default) or to
               filename if specified (since dpkg 1.18.5).
           -?, --help
               Show the usage message and exit.
           --version
               Show the version and exit.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           DPKG_COLORS
               Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
               accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.
           DPKG_NLS
               If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
               Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
               i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are:
               0 and 1 (default).
## FILES         top
           debian/files
               The list of generated files which are part of the upload
               being prepared.  dpkg-genchanges reads the data here when
               producing a .changes file.
