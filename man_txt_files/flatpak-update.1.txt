## NAME         top
           flatpak-update - Update an application or runtime
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak update [OPTION...] [REF...]
           flatpak update [OPTION...] --appstream [REMOTE]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Updates applications and runtimes.  REF is a reference to the
           application or runtime to update. If no REF is given, everything
           is updated, as well as appstream info for all remotes.
           Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak
           ref format, which looks like "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All
           elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including
           the slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any
           part left out will be matched against what is installed, and if
           there are multiple matches an error message will list the
           alternatives.
           By default this looks for both apps and runtimes with the given
           REF, but you can limit this by using the --app or --runtime
           option, or by supplying the initial element in the REF.
           Normally, this command updates the application to the tip of its
           branch. But it is possible to check out another commit, with the
           --commit option.
           If the configured remote for a ref being updated has a collection
           ID configured on it, Flatpak will search the sideload-repos
           directories configured either with the --sideload-repo option, or
           on a per-installation or system-wide basis (see flatpak(1)).
           Note that updating a runtime is different from installing a
           different branch, and runtime updates are expected to keep strict
           compatibility. If an application update does cause a problem, it
           is possible to go back to the previous version, with the --commit
           option.
           In addition to updates, this command will offer to uninstall any
           unused end-of-life runtimes. Runtimes that were explicitly
           installed (not as a dependency) or explicitly pinned (see
           flatpak-pin(1)) are left installed even if unused and
           end-of-life.
           Unless overridden with the --user, --system or --installation
           option, this command updates any matching refs in the standard
           system-wide installation and the per-user one.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -u, --user
               Update a per-user installation.
           --system
               Update the default system-wide installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Updates a system-wide installation specified by NAME among
               those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --arch=ARCH
               The architecture to update for. See flatpak
               --supported-arches for architectures supported by the host.
           --subpath=PATH
               Install only a subpath of the ref. This is mainly used to
               install a subset of locales. This can be added multiple times
               to install multiple subpaths. If this is not specified the
               subpaths specified at install time are reused.
           --commit=COMMIT
               Update to this commit, instead of the tip of the branch. You
               can find commits using flatpak remote-info --log REMOTE REF.
           --no-deploy
               Download the latest version, but don't deploy it.
           --no-pull
               Don't download the latest version, deploy whatever is locally
               available.
           --no-related
               Don't download related extensions, such as the locale data.
           --no-deps
               Don't update or install runtime dependencies when installing.
           --app
               Only look for an app with the given name.
           --appstream
               Update appstream for REMOTE, or all remotes if no remote is
               specified.
           --runtime
               Only look for a runtime with the given name.
           --sideload-repo=PATH
               Adds an extra local ostree repo as a source for installation.
               This is equivalent to using the sideload-repos directories
               (see flatpak(1)), but can be done on a per-command basis. Any
               path added here is used in addition to ones in those
               directories.
           -y, --assumeyes
               Automatically answer yes to all questions (or pick the most
               prioritized answer). This is useful for automation.
           --noninteractive
               Produce minimal output and avoid most questions. This is
               suitable for use in non-interactive situations, e.g. in a
               build script.
           --force-remove
               Remove old files even if they're in use by a running
               application.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
