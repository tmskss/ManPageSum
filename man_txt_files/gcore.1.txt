## NAME         top
           gcore - Generate a core file of a running program
## SYNOPSIS         top
           gcore [-a] [-o prefix] pid1 [pid2...pidN]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Generate core dumps of one or more running programs with process
           IDs pid1, pid2, etc.  A core file produced by gcore is equivalent
           to one produced by the kernel when the process crashes (and when
           "ulimit -c" was used to set up an appropriate core dump limit).
           However, unlike after a crash, after gcore finishes its job the
           program remains running without any change.
## OPTIONS         top
           -a  Dump all memory mappings.  The actual effect of this option
               depends on the Operating System.  On GNU/Linux, it will
               disable "use-coredump-filter" and enable
               "dump-excluded-mappings".
           -o prefix
               The optional argument prefix specifies the prefix to be used
               when composing the file names of the core dumps.  The file
               name is composed as prefix.pid, where pid is the process ID
               of the running program being analyzed by gcore.  If not
               specified, prefix defaults to gcore.
## SEE ALSO         top
           The full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
           If the "info" and "gdb" programs and GDB's Texinfo documentation
           are properly installed at your site, the command
                   info gdb
           should give you access to the complete manual.
