## NAME         top
           pmdaactivemq - ActiveMQ performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdaactivemq is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports performance metrics from ActiveMQ.
## INSTALLATION         top
           This PMDA requires that ActiveMQ has been installed with the
           Jolokia JMX-HTTP bridge enabled. By default the PNDA will connect
           to localhost at port 8161 with a username and password of
           'admin'. This can be configured in
           PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq/activemq.conf
           Install the ActiveMQ PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq
               # ./Remove
           pmdaactivemq is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq/activemq.conf
               optional configuration file for pmdaactivemq
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq/Install
               installation script for the pmdaactivemq agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdaactivemq agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/activemq.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdaactivemq
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
