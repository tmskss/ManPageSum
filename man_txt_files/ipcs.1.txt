## NAME         top
           ipcs - show information on IPC facilities
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ipcs [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ipcs shows information on System V inter-process communication
           facilities. By default it shows information about all three
           resources: shared memory segments, message queues, and semaphore
           arrays.
## OPTIONS         top
           -i, --id id
               Show full details on just the one resource element identified
               by id. This option needs to be combined with one of the three
               resource options: -m, -q or -s.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
       Resource options
           -m, --shmems
               Write information about active shared memory segments.
           -q, --queues
               Write information about active message queues.
           -s, --semaphores
               Write information about active semaphore sets.
           -a, --all
               Write information about all three resources (default).
       Output formats
           Of these options only one takes effect: the last one specified.
           -c, --creator
               Show creator and owner.
           -l, --limits
               Show resource limits.
           -p, --pid
               Show PIDs of creator and last operator.
           -t, --time
               Write time information. The time of the last control
               operation that changed the access permissions for all
               facilities, the time of the last msgsnd(2) and msgrcv(2)
               operations on message queues, the time of the last shmat(2)
               and shmdt(2) operations on shared memory, and the time of the
               last semop(2) operation on semaphores.
           -u, --summary
               Show status summary.
       Representation
           These affect only the -l (--limits) option.
           -b, --bytes
               Print the sizes in bytes rather than in a human-readable
               format.
               By default, the unit, sizes are expressed in, is byte, and
               unit prefixes are in power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of
               symbols are exhibited truncated in order to reach a better
               readability, by exhibiting alone the first letter of them;
               examples: "1 KiB" and "1 MiB" are respectively exhibited as
               "1 K" and "1 M", then omitting on purpose the mention "iB",
               which is part of these abbreviations.
           --human
               Print sizes in human-readable format.
## CONFORMING TO         top
           The Linux ipcs utility is not fully compatible to the POSIX ipcs
           utility. The Linux version does not support the POSIX -a, -b and
           -o options, but does support the -l and -u options not defined by
           POSIX. A portable application shall not use the -a, -b, -o, -l,
           and -u options.
## NOTES         top
           The current implementation of ipcs obtains information about
           available IPC resources by parsing the files in /proc/sysvipc.
           Before util-linux version v2.23, an alternate mechanism was used:
           the IPC_STAT command of msgctl(2), semctl(2), and shmctl(2). This
           mechanism is also used in later util-linux versions in the case
           where /proc is unavailable. A limitation of the IPC_STAT
           mechanism is that it can only be used to retrieve information
           about IPC resources for which the user has read permission.
