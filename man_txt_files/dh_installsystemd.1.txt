## NAME         top
           dh_installsystemd - install systemd unit files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installsystemd [debhelper options] [--restart-after-upgrade]
           [--no-stop-on-upgrade] [--no-enable] [--no-start] [--name=name]

## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installsystemd is a debhelper program that is responsible for
           installing package maintainer supplied systemd unit files.
           It also finds the service files installed by a package and
           generates preinst, postinst, and prerm code blocks for enabling,
           disabling, starting, stopping, and restarting the corresponding
           systemd services, when the package is installed, updated, or
           removed. These snippets are added to the maintainer scripts by
           dh_installdeb(1).
           deb-systemd-helper(1) is used to enable and disable systemd
           units, thus it is not necessary that the machine actually runs
           systemd during package installation time, enabling happens on all
           machines in order to be able to switch from sysvinit to systemd
           and back.
           dh_installsystemd operates on all unit files installed by a
           package. For only generating blocks for specific unit files, pass
           them as arguments, "dh_installsystemd quota.service". Specific
           unit files can be excluded from processing using the -X common
           debhelper(1) option.
## FILES         top
           debian/package.mount, debian/package.path, debian/package@.path,
           debian/package.service, debian/package@.service,
           debian/package.socket, debian/package@.socket,
           debian/package.target, debian/package@.target,
           debian/package.timer, debian/package@.timer
               If any of those files exists, they are installed into
               lib/systemd/system/ in the package build directory.
           debian/package.tmpfile
               Only used in compat 12 or earlier.  In compat 13+, this file
               is handled by dh_installtmpfiles(1) instead.
               If this exists, it is installed into usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ in
               the package build directory. Note that the "tmpfiles.d"
               mechanism is currently only used by systemd.
## OPTIONS         top
           --no-enable
               Disable the service(s) on purge, but do not enable them on
               install.
               Note that this option does not affect whether the services
               are started.  Please remember to also use --no-start if the
               service should not be started.
           --name=name
               This option controls several things.
               It changes the name that dh_installsystemd uses when it looks
               for maintainer provided systemd unit files as listed in the
               "FILES" section.  As an example, dh_installsystemd --name foo
               will look for debian/package.foo.service instead of
               debian/package.service).  These unit files are installed as
               name.unit-extension (in the example, it would be installed as
               foo.service).
               Furthermore, if no unit files are passed explicitly as
               command line arguments, dh_installsystemd will only act on
               unit files called name (rather than all unit files found in
               the package).
           --restart-after-upgrade
               Do not stop the unit file until after the package upgrade has
               been completed.  This is the default behaviour in compat 10.
               In earlier compat levels the default was to stop the unit
               file in the prerm, and start it again in the postinst.
               This can be useful for daemons that should not have a
               possibly long downtime during upgrade. But you should make
               sure that the daemon will not get confused by the package
               being upgraded while it's running before using this option.
           --no-restart-after-upgrade
               Undo a previous --restart-after-upgrade (or the default of
               compat 10).  If no other options are given, this will cause
               the service to be stopped in the prerm script and started
               again in the postinst script.
           -r, --no-stop-on-upgrade, --no-restart-on-upgrade
               Do not stop service on upgrade. This has the side-effect of
               not restarting the service as a part of the upgrade.
               If you want to restart the service with minimal downtime,
               please use --restart-after-upgrade (default in compat 10 or
               later).  If you want the service to be restarted but be
               stopped during the upgrade, then please use
               --no-restart-after-upgrade (note the "after-upgrade").
               Note that the --no-restart-on-upgrade alias is deprecated and
               will be removed in compat 14.  This is to avoid confusion
               with the --no-restart-after-upgrade option.
           --no-start
               Do not start the unit file after upgrades and after initial
               installation (the latter is only relevant for services
               without a corresponding init script).
               Note that this option does not affect whether the services
               are enabled.  Please remember to also use --no-enable if the
               services should not be enabled.
           unit file ...
               Only process and generate maintscripts for the installed unit
               files with the (base)name unit file.
               Note: dh_installsystemd will still install unit files from
               debian/ but it will not generate any maintscripts for them
               unless they are explicitly listed in unit file ...
## NOTES         top
           This command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called
           between invocations of this command (with the same arguments).
           Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be
           added to maintainer scripts.
