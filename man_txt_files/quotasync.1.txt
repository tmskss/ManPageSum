## NAME         top
           quotasync - synchronize in-kernel file system usage and limits to
           disk format
## SYNOPSIS         top
           quotasync [ -ugP ] mount-point...
           quotasync [ -ugP ] -a
           quotasync -h | -V
## DESCRIPTION         top
           quotasync flushes file system usage and limits from kernel memory
           to quota files stored in the file system. By default only the
           user quotas are synchronized.
           This tool can be useful if you want to display accurate quotas by
           tools that parse quota files, like repquota(8).
## OPTIONS         top
           -u, --user
                  Synchronize user usage and limits.
           -g, --group
                  Synchronize group usage and limits.
           -P, --project
                  Synchronize project usage and limits.
           -a, --all
                  Synchronize usage and limits on all file systems. You have
                  to specify this option or to specify desired file systems.
           -V, --version
                  Show program version information and exit.
           -h, --help
                  Show program usage and exit.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           If requested synchronization fails, or invalid option is given,
           quotasync will terminate with non-zero exit code. Otherwise it
           will return zero.
## FILES         top
           aquota.user  or  aquota.group
                  Quota file at the file system root (version 2 quota, non-
                  XFS/GFS2 file systems).
           quota.user  or  quota.group
                  Quota file at the file system root (version 1 quota, non-
                  XFS/GFS2 file systems).
           /etc/mtab
                  List of mounted file systems maintained by user space.
           /proc/mounts
                  List of mounted file systems maintained by kernel.
