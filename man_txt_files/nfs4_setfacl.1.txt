## NAME         top
           nfs4_setfacl, nfs4_editfacl - manipulate NFSv4 file/directory
           access control lists
## SYNOPSIS         top
           nfs4_setfacl [OPTIONS] COMMAND file...
           nfs4_editfacl [OPTIONS] file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           nfs4_setfacl manipulates the NFSv4 Access Control List (ACL) of
           one or more files (or directories), provided they are on a
           mounted NFSv4 filesystem which supports ACLs.
           nfs4_editfacl is equivalent to nfs4_setfacl -e.
           Refer to the nfs4_acl(5) manpage for information about NFSv4 ACL
           terminology and syntax.
       COMMANDS
           -a acl_spec
                  add the ACEs from acl_spec to file's ACL.  ACEs are
                  inserted starting at the default position 1 of file's ACL.
           -A acl_file
                  add the ACEs from the acl_spec in acl_file to file's ACL.
                  ACEs are inserted starting at the default position 1 of
                  file's ACL.
           -x acl_spec
                  delete ACEs matched from acl_spec from file's ACL.  Note
                  that the ordering of the ACEs in acl_spec does not matter.
           -X acl_file
                  delete ACEs matched from the acl_spec in acl_file from
                  file's ACL.  Note that the ordering of the ACEs in the
                  acl_spec does not matter.
           -i index
                  ACEs are inserted or deleted starting at the indexth
                  position (DEFAULT: 1) of file's ACL.  It can be used only
                  with the add or delete action.
           -s acl_spec
                  set file's ACL to acl_spec.
           -S acl_file
                  set file's ACL to the acl_spec in acl_file.
           -e, --edit
                  edit file's ACL in the editor defined in the EDITOR
                  environment variable (DEFAULT: vi(1)) and set the
                  resulting ACL upon a clean exit, assuming changes made in
                  the editor were saved.  Note that if multiple files are
                  specified, the editor will be serially invoked once per
                  file.
           -m from_ace to_ace
                  modify file's ACL in-place by replacing from_ace with
                  to_ace.
           -?, -h, --help
                  display help text and exit.
           --version
                  display this program's version and exit.
           NOTE: if '-' is given as the acl_file with the -A/-X/-S flags,
           the acl_spec will be read from stdin.
       OPTIONS
           -R, --recursive
                  recursively apply to a directory's files and
                  subdirectories.  Similar to setfacl(1), the default
                  behavior is to follow symlinks given on the command line
                  and to skip symlinks encountered while recursing through
                  directories.
           -L, --logical
                  in conjunction with -R/--recursive, a logical walk follows
                  all symbolic links.
           -P, --physical
                  in conjunction with -R/--recursive, a physical walk skips
                  all symbolic links.
           --dacl
                  acts on the dacl only. This functionality is only
                  available if the server supports NFSv4 minor version 1 or
                  newer.
           --sacl
                  acts on the sacl only. This functionality is only
                  available if the server supports NFSv4 minor version 1 or
                  newer.
           --test
                  display results of COMMAND, but do not save changes.
## PERMISSIONS ALIASES         top
           With nfs4_setfacl, one can use simple abbreviations ("aliases")
           to express generic "read" (R), generic "write" (W), and generic
           "execute" (X) permissions, familiar from the POSIX mode bits used
           by, e.g., chmod(1).  To use these aliases, one can put them in
           the permissions field of an NFSv4 ACE and nfs4_setfacl will
           convert them: an R is expanded to rntcy, a W is expanded to
           watTNcCy (with D added to directory ACEs), and an X is expanded
           to xtcy.  Please refer to the nfs4_acl(5) manpage for information
           on specific NFSv4 ACE permissions.
           For example, if one wanted to grant generic "read" and "write"
           access on a file, the NFSv4 permissions field would normally
           contain something like rwatTnNcCy.  Instead, one might use
           aliases to accomplish the same goal with RW.
           The two permissions not included in any of the aliases are d
           (delete) and o (write-owner).  However, they can still be used:
           e.g., a permissions field consisting of Wdo expresses generic
           "write" access as well as the ability to delete and change
           ownership.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Assume that the file `foo' has the following NFSv4 ACL for the
           following examples:
                  A::OWNER@:rwatTnNcCy
                  D::OWNER@:x
                  A:g:GROUP@:rtncy
                  D:g:GROUP@:waxTC
                  A::EVERYONE@:rtncy
                  D::EVERYONE@:waxTC
           - add ACE granting `alice@nfsdomain.org' generic "read" and
             "execute" access (defaults to prepending ACE to ACL):
                  $ nfs4_setfacl -a A::alice@nfsdomain.org:rxtncy foo
           - add the same ACE as above, but using aliases:
                  $ nfs4_setfacl -a A::alice@nfsdomain.org:RX foo
           - add the same ACE as above, at index 2:
                  $ nfs4_setfacl -i 2 -a A::alice@nfsdomain.org:RX foo
           - edit existing ACL in a text editor and set modified ACL on
             clean save/exit:
                  $ nfs4_setfacl -e foo
           - set ACL (overwrites original) to contents of a spec_file named
             `newacl.txt':
                  $ nfs4_setfacl -S newacl.txt foo
           - recursively set the ACLs of all files and subdirectories in the
             current directory, skipping all symlinks encountered, to the
             ACL contained in the spec_file named `newacl.txt':
                  $ nfs4_setfacl -R -P -S newacl.txt *
           - delete the first ACE, but only print the resulting ACL (does
             not save changes):
                  $ nfs4_setfacl --test -x -i 1 foo
           - delete the last two ACEs above:
                  $ nfs4_setfacl -x A::EVERYONE@rtncy,D::EVERYONE@:waxTC foo
           - modify (in-place) the second ACE above:
                  $ nfs4_setfacl -m D::OWNER@:x  D::OWNER@:xo foo
           - set ACLs of `bar' and `frobaz' to ACL of `foo':
                  $ nfs4_getfacl foo | nfs4_setfacl -S - bar frobaz
