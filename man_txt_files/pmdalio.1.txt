## NAME         top
           pmdalio - Linux LIO subsystem PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdalio is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values about the Linux I/O target subsystem, which
           provides for protocols like iSCSI, FCP, FCoE.  These allow
           storage available on one host to be exported and consumed by
           other hosts using industry standard protocols.
           This PMDA exports summary metrics which are performance value
           aggregations and configuration per LIO target instance.
           Additionally, it provides per LUN performance metrics including
           IOPS, and READ and WRITE throughput.
           The LIO configuration is maintained within the kernel's configfs
           virtual filesystem.  The python-rtslib module provides an
           interface to configfs, allowing tools like pmdalio to interact
           with the settings and metadata held in configfs.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install the lio PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio
               # ./Remove
           pmdalio is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio/Install
               installation script for the pmdalio agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio/Remove

           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/lio.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdalio
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
