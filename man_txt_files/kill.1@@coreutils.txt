## NAME         top

## SYNOPSIS         top

## DESCRIPTION         top
           Send signals to processes, or list signals.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -s, --signal=SIGNAL, -SIGNAL
                  specify the name or number of the signal to be sent
           -l, --list
                  list signal names, or convert signal names to/from numbers
           -t, --table
                  print a table of signal information
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           SIGNAL may be a signal name like 'HUP', or a signal number like
           '1', or the exit status of a process terminated by a signal.  PID
           is an integer; if negative it identifies a process group.
           NOTE: your shell may have its own version of kill, which usually
           supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your
           shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
