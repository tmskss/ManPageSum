## NAME         top
           flatpak-make-current - Make a specific version of an app current
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak make-current [OPTION...] APP BRANCH
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Makes a particular branch of an application current. Only the
           current branch of an app has its exported files (such as desktop
           files and icons) made visible to the host.
           When a new branch is installed it will automatically be made
           current, so this command is often not needed.
           Unless overridden with the --user or --installation options, this
           command changes the default system-wide installation.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -u, --user
               Update a per-user installation.
           --system
               Update the default system-wide installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Updates a system-wide installation specified by NAME among
               those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --arch=ARCH
               The architecture to make current for. See flatpak
               --supported-arches for architectures supported by the host.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
## EXAMPLES         top
           $ flatpak --user make-current org.gnome.gedit 3.14
