## NAME         top
           pmdalustrecomm - Lustre filesystem comms performance metrics
           domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm/pmdalustrecomm [-d domain] [-l logfile]
           [-U username]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdalustrecomm is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts performance metrics from the Linux procfs filesystem
           about the state of various aspects of the Lustre filesystem.
           The lustrecomm PMDA exports metrics that focus on distributed
           communication in the filesystem, including metrics related to
           timeouts, network drops, send/recv information and route lengths.
           However, it also covers the memory use of some of the Lustre
           filesystem components.
           A brief description of the pmdalustrecomm command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                lustrecomm.log is written in the current directory of
                pmcd(1) when pmdalustrecomm is started, i.e.
                $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file cannot be created or is
                not writable, output is written to the standard error
                instead.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           lustrecomm performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm
                # ./Remove
           pmdalustrecomm is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
           executed directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1)
           when the agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH
                  command line options used to launch pmdalustrecomm
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm/help
                  default help text file for the lustrecomm metrics
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm/Install
                  installation script for the pmdalustrecomm agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm/Remove
                  undo installation script for the pmdalustrecomm agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/lustrecomm.log
                  default log file for error messages and other information
                  from pmdalustrecomm
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
