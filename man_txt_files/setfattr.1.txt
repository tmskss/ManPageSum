    SETFATTR(1)                  File Utilities                  SETFATTR(1)
## NAME         top
           setfattr - set extended attributes of filesystem objects
## SYNOPSIS         top
           setfattr [-h] -n name [-v value] pathname...
           setfattr [-h] -x name pathname...
           setfattr [-h] --restore=file
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The setfattr command associates a new value with an extended
           attribute name for each specified file.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n name, --name=name
               Specifies the name of the extended attribute to set.
           -v value, --value=value
               Specifies the new value of the extended attribute. There are
               three methods available for encoding the value.  If the given
               string is enclosed in double quotes, the inner string is
               treated as text. In that case, backslashes and double quotes
               have special meanings and need to be escaped by a preceding
               backslash. Any control characters can be encoded as a
               backslash followed by three digits as its ASCII code in
               octal. If the given string begins with 0x or 0X, it expresses
               a hexadecimal number. If the given string begins with 0s or
               0S, base64 encoding is expected.  Also see the --encoding
               option of getfattr(1).
           -x name, --remove=name
               Remove the named extended attribute entirely.
           -h, --no-dereference
               Do not follow symlinks.  If pathname is a symbolic link, it
               is not followed, but is instead itself the inode being
               modified.
           --restore=file
               Restores extended attributes from file.  The file must be in
               the format generated by the getfattr command with the --dump
               option.  If a dash (-) is given as the file name, setfattr
               reads from standard input.
           --raw
               Do not decode the attribute value. Can be used to set values
               obtained with getfattr --only-values.
           --version
               Print the version of setfattr and exit.
           --help
               Print help explaining the command line options.
           --  End of command line options.  All remaining parameters are
               interpreted as file names, even if they start with a dash
               character.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Add extended attribute to user namespace:
           $ setfattr -n user.foo -v bar file.txt
           To add md5sum of the file as an extended attribute:
           # setfattr -n trusted.md5sum -v d41d8cd98f00b204e00998ecf8427e file.txt
