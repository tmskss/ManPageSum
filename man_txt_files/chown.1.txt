## NAME         top
           chown - change file owner and group
## SYNOPSIS         top
           chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...
           chown [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This manual page documents the GNU version of chown.  chown
           changes the user and/or group ownership of each given file.  If
           only an owner (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that
           user is made the owner of each given file, and the files' group
           is not changed.  If the owner is followed by a colon and a group
           name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the
           group ownership of the files is changed as well.  If a colon but
           no group name follows the user name, that user is made the owner
           of the files and the group of the files is changed to that user's
           login group.  If the colon and group are given, but the owner is
           omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this case,
           chown performs the same function as chgrp.  If only a colon is
           given, or if the entire operand is empty, neither the owner nor
           the group is changed.
## OPTIONS         top
           Change the owner and/or group of each FILE to OWNER and/or GROUP.
           With --reference, change the owner and group of each FILE to
           those of RFILE.
           -c, --changes
                  like verbose but report only when a change is made
           -f, --silent, --quiet
                  suppress most error messages
           -v, --verbose
                  output a diagnostic for every file processed
           --dereference
                  affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the
                  default), rather than the symbolic link itself
           -h, --no-dereference
                  affect symbolic links instead of any referenced file
                  (useful only on systems that can change the ownership of a
                  symlink)
           --from=CURRENT_OWNER:CURRENT_GROUP
                  change the owner and/or group of each file only if its
                  current owner and/or group match those specified here.
                  Either may be omitted, in which case a match is not
                  required for the omitted attribute
           --no-preserve-root
                  do not treat '/' specially (the default)
           --preserve-root
                  fail to operate recursively on '/'
           --reference=RFILE
                  use RFILE's owner and group rather than specifying
                  OWNER:GROUP values.  RFILE is always dereferenced.
           -R, --recursive
                  operate on files and directories recursively
           The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when
           the -R option is also specified.  If more than one is specified,
           only the final one takes effect.
           -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a
                  directory, traverse it
           -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered
           -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           Owner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged if missing,
           but changed to login group if implied by a ':' following a
           symbolic OWNER.  OWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well as
           symbolic.
## EXAMPLES         top
           chown root /u
                  Change the owner of /u to "root".
           chown root:staff /u
                  Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".
           chown -hR root /u
                  Change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".
