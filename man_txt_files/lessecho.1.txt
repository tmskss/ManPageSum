## NAME         top
           lessecho - expand metacharacters
## SYNOPSIS         top
           lessecho [-ox] [-cx] [-pn] [-dn] [-mx] [-nn] [-ex] [-a] file ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           lessecho is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard
           output.  But any metacharacter in the output is preceded by an
           "escape" character, which by default is a backslash.
## OPTIONS         top
           A summary of options is included below.
           -ex    Specifies "x", rather than backslash, to be the escape
                  char for metachars.  If x is "-", no escape char is used
                  and arguments containing metachars are surrounded by
                  quotes instead.
           -ox    Specifies "x", rather than double-quote, to be the open
                  quote character, which is used if the -e- option is
                  specified.
           -cx    Specifies "x" to be the close quote character.
           -pn    Specifies "n" to be the open quote character, as an
                  integer.
           -dn    Specifies "n" to be the close quote character, as an
                  integer.
           -mx    Specifies "x" to be a metachar.  By default, no characters
                  are considered metachars.
           -nn    Specifies "n" to be a metachar, as an integer.
           -fn    Specifies "n" to be the escape char for metachars, as an
                  integer.
           -a     Specifies that all arguments are to be quoted.  The
                  default is that only arguments containing metacharacters
                  are quoted.
