## NAME         top
           flatpak-build-bundle - Create a single-file bundle from a local
           repository
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak build-bundle [OPTION...] LOCATION FILENAME NAME [BRANCH]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Creates a single-file named FILENAME for the application (or
           runtime) named NAME in the repository at LOCATION. If a BRANCH is
           specified, this branch of the application is used.
           The collection ID set on the repository at LOCATION (if set) will
           be used for the bundle.
           Unless --oci is used, the format of the bundle file is that of an
           ostree static delta (against an empty base) with some flatpak
           specific metadata for the application icons and appdata.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           --runtime
               Export a runtime instead of an application.
           --arch=ARCH
               The arch to create a bundle for. See flatpak
               --supported-arches for architectures supported by the host.
           --repo-url=URL
               The URL for the repository from which the application can be
               updated. Installing the bundle will automatically configure a
               remote for this URL.
           --runtime-repo=URL
               The URL for a .flatpakrepo file that contains the information
               about the repository that supplies the runtimes required by
               the app.
           --gpg-keys=FILE
               Add the GPG key from FILE (use - for stdin).
           --gpg-homedir=PATH
               GPG Homedir to use when looking for keyrings.
           --from-commit=COMMIT
               The OSTree commit to create a delta bundle from.
           --oci
               Export to an OCI image instead of a Flatpak bundle.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
