## NAME         top
           seq - print a sequence of numbers
## SYNOPSIS         top
           seq [OPTION]... LAST
           seq [OPTION]... FIRST LAST
           seq [OPTION]... FIRST INCREMENT LAST
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -f, --format=FORMAT
                  use printf style floating-point FORMAT
           -s, --separator=STRING
                  use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)
           -w, --equal-width
                  equalize width by padding with leading zeroes
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           If FIRST or INCREMENT is omitted, it defaults to 1.  That is, an
           omitted INCREMENT defaults to 1 even when LAST is smaller than
           FIRST.  The sequence of numbers ends when the sum of the current
           number and INCREMENT would become greater than LAST.  FIRST,
           INCREMENT, and LAST are interpreted as floating point values.
           INCREMENT is usually positive if FIRST is smaller than LAST, and
           INCREMENT is usually negative if FIRST is greater than LAST.
           INCREMENT must not be 0; none of FIRST, INCREMENT and LAST may be
           NaN.  FORMAT must be suitable for printing one argument of type
           'double'; it defaults to %.PRECf if FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST
           are all fixed point decimal numbers with maximum precision PREC,
           and to %g otherwise.
