## DESCRIPTION         top
           Import patches from various sources to the stack.
           The simplest usage is to import a diff/patch file into the stack
           from a local file. By default, the file name is used as the patch
           name, but this can be overridden with --name. The patch can
           either be a normal file with the description at the top, or it
           can have standard mail format. The "Subject", "From", and "Date"
           headers will be used for the imported patch’s author details.
           Patches may also be imported from a mail file (-m/--mail), an
           mbox (-M/--mbox), or a series (-S/--series). Furthermore, the
           -u/--url option allows the patches source to be fetched from a
           url instead of from a local file.
           If a patch does not apply cleanly, the failed diff is written to
           a .stgit-failed.patch file and an empty patch is added to the
           stack.
           The patch description must be separated from the diff with a
           "---" line.
## OPTIONS         top
           -m, --mail
               Import patch from an email file
           -M, --mbox
               Import patch series from an mbox file
           -S, --series
               Import patch series from a series file are tar archive.
           -u, --url
               Retrieve source from a url instead of local file
           -n <name>, --name=<name>
               Use <name> as the patch name
           -p <n>, --strip=<n>
               Remove <n> leading components from diff paths (default 1)
           --directory=<root>
               Prepend <root> to all filenames. If a "-p" argument is also
               passed, it is applied before prepending the new root.
           -t, --stripname
               Strip number and extension from patch name
           -C <n>
               Ensure <n> lines of matching context for each change
           -3, --3way
               Attempt 3-way merge if the patch records the identity of
               blobs it is supposed to apply to and those blobs are
               available locally.
           -i, --ignore
               Ignore the applied patches in the series
           --replace
               Replace the unapplied patches in the series
           -b <committish>, --base=<committish>
               Use <committish> instead of HEAD for file importing
           --reject
               Leave rejected hunks in ".rej" files
           --keep-cr
               Do not remove "\r" from email lines ending with "\r\n"
           --message-id
               Create Message-ID trailer in patch description based on the
               Message-ID email header. This option is applicable when
               importing with --mail or --mbox. This behavior may also be
               enabled via the "stgit.import.message-id" configuration
               option.
           -e, --edit
               Invoke editor for patch description
           -d, --diff
               Show diff when editing patch description
           --no-verify
               Disable commit-msg hook
           -s[=<value>], --signoff[=<value>]

           --ack[=<value>]
               Add "Acked-by" message trailer.
               The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
               and email. This option may be provided multiple times.
           --review[=<value>]
               Add "Reviewed-by" message trailer.
               The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
               and email. This option may be provided multiple times.
           --author=<name-and-email>
               Set the author "name <email>"
           --authname=<name>
               Set the author name

           --committer-date-is-author-date
