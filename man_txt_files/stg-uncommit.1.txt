    STG-UNCOMMIT(1)               StGit Manual               STG-UNCOMMIT(1)
## NAME         top
           stg-uncommit - Convert regular Git commits into StGit patches
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg uncommit <patchname-1> [<patchname-2> ...]
           stg uncommit -n number [<patchname-prefix>]
           stg uncommit -t <committish> [-x]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Convert one or more Git commits from the base of the current
           stack into StGit patches. The original Git commits are not
           modified; the StGit stack extends to incorporate these commits as
           the bottommost applied patches. This is the opposite of
           stg-commit(1).
           By default, the number of patches to uncommit is determined by
           the number of patch names provided on the command line. The first
           provided name is used for the first patch to uncommit, i.e. for
           the newest patch.
           The -n/--number option specifies the number of patches to
           uncommit. In this case, at most one patch name may be specified.
           It is used as prefix to which the patch number is appended. If no
           patch names are provided on the command line, StGit automatically
           generates names based on the first lines of the commit messages.
           The -t/--to option specifies that all commits up to and including
           the given commit should be uncommitted. The -x/--exclusive option
           may be used to exclude the "to" commit.
           Only commits with exactly one parent can be uncommitted; in other
           words, merge commits may not be uncommitted.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n <number>, --number=<number>
               Uncommit the specified number of commits
           -t <committish>, --to=<committish>
               Uncommit to the specified committish
           -x, --exclusive
               Exclude the commit specified by the --to option
