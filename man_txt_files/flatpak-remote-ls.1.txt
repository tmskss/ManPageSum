    FLATPAK REMOTE-LS(1)        flatpak remote-ls       FLATPAK REMOTE-LS(1)
## NAME         top
           flatpak-remote-ls - Show available runtimes and applications
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak remote-ls [OPTION...] [REMOTE]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Shows runtimes and applications that are available in the remote
           repository with the name REMOTE, or all remotes if one isn't
           specified. You can find all configured remote repositories with
           flatpak remotes.
           REMOTE can be a file:// URI pointing to a local repository
           instead of a remote name.
           Unless overridden with the --system, --user, or --installation
           options, this command uses either the default system-wide
           installation or the per-user one, depending on which has the
           specified REMOTE.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -u, --user
               Use the per-user configuration.
           --system
               Use the default system-wide configuration.
           --installation=NAME
               Use a system-wide installation specified by NAME among those
               defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --cached
               Prefer to use locally cached information if possible, even
               though it may be out of date. This is faster, but risks
               returning stale information.
           -d, --show-details
               Show arches, branches and commit ids, in addition to the
               names. Equivalent to --columns=all.
           --runtime
               Show only runtimes, omit applications.
           --app
               Show only applications, omit runtimes.
           --all, -a
               Show everything. By default locale and debug extensions as
               well as secondary arches when the primary arch is available
               are hidden.
           --updates
               Show only those which have updates available.
           --arch=ARCH
               Show only those matching the specified architecture. By
               default, only supported architectures are shown. Use --arch=*
               to show all architectures. See flatpak --supported-arches for
               architectures supported by the host.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
           --app-runtime=RUNTIME
               List applications that use the given runtime
           --columns=FIELD,...
               Specify what information to show about each ref. You can list
               multiple fields, or use this option multiple times.
               Append :s[tart], :m[iddle], :e[nd] or :f[ull] to column names
               to change ellipsization.
## FIELDS         top
           The following fields are understood by the --columns option:
           name
               Show the name
           description
               Show the application description
           application
               Show the application or runtime ID
           arch
               Show the arch
           branch
               Show the branch
           version
               Show the version
           ref
               Show the ref
           origin
               Show the origin remote

               Show the installed size
           download-size
               Show the download size
           options

           help
               Show the list of available columns
           Note that field names can be abbreviated to a unique prefix.
