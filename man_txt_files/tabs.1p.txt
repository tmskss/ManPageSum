    TABS(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               TABS(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           tabs — set terminal tabs
## SYNOPSIS         top
           tabs [-n|-a|-a2|-c|-c2|-c3|-f|-p|-s|-u] [-T type]
           tabs [-T type] n[[sep[+]n]...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The tabs utility shall display a series of characters that first
           clears the hardware terminal tab settings and then initializes
           the tab stops at the specified positions and optionally adjusts
           the margin.
           The phrase ``tab-stop position N'' shall be taken to mean that,
           from the start of a line of output, tabbing to position N shall
           cause the next character output to be in the (N+1)th column
           position on that line. The maximum number of tab stops allowed is
           terminal-dependent.
           It need not be possible to implement tabs on certain terminals.
           If the terminal type obtained from the TERM environment variable
           or -T option represents such a terminal, an appropriate
           diagnostic message shall be written to standard error and tabs
           shall exit with a status greater than zero.
## OPTIONS         top
           The tabs utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except for
           various extensions: the options -a2, -c2, and -c3 are multi-
           character.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -n        Specify repetitive tab stops separated by a uniform
                     number of column positions, n, where n is a single-
                     digit decimal number. The default usage of tabs with no
                     arguments shall be equivalent to tabs -8. When -0 is
                     used, the tab stops shall be cleared and no new ones
                     set.
           -a        1,10,16,36,72
                     Assembler, applicable to some mainframes.
           -a2       1,10,16,40,72
                     Assembler, applicable to some mainframes.
           -c        1,8,12,16,20,55
                     COBOL, normal format.
           -c2       1,6,10,14,49
                     COBOL, compact format (columns 1 to 6 omitted).
           -c3       1,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34,38,42,46,50,54,58,62,67
                     COBOL compact format (columns 1 to 6 omitted), with
                     more tabs than -c2.
           -f        1,7,11,15,19,23
                     FORTRAN
           -p        1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61
                     PL/1
           -s        1,10,55
                     SNOBOL
           -u        1,12,20,44
                     Assembler, applicable to some mainframes.
           -T type   Indicate the type of terminal. If this option is not
                     supplied and the TERM variable is unset or null, an
                     unspecified default terminal type shall be used. The
                     setting of type shall take precedence over the value in
                     TERM.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           n[[sep[+]n]...]
                     A single command line argument that consists of one or
                     more tab-stop values (n) separated by a separator
                     character (sep) which is either a <comma> or a <blank>
                     character. The application shall ensure that the tab-
                     stop values are positive decimal integers in strictly
                     ascending order. If any tab-stop value (except the
                     first one) is preceded by a <plus-sign>, it is taken as
                     an increment to be added to the previous value. For
                     example, the tab lists 1,10,20,30 and "110+10+10" are
                     considered to be identical.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           tabs:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
           TERM      Determine the terminal type. If this variable is unset
                     or null, and if the -T option is not specified, an
                     unspecified default terminal type shall be used.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           If standard output is a terminal, the appropriate sequence to
           clear and set the tab stops may be written to standard output in
           an unspecified format. If standard output is not a terminal,
           undefined results occur.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           This utility makes use of the terminal's hardware tabs and the
           stty tabs option.
           This utility is not recommended for application use.
           Some integrated display units might not have escape sequences to
           set tab stops, but may be set by internal system calls. On these
           terminals, tabs works if standard output is directed to the
           terminal; if output is directed to another file, however, tabs
           fails.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           Consideration was given to having the tput utility handle all of
           the functions described in tabs.  However, the separate tabs
           utility was retained because it seems more intuitive to use a
           command named tabs than tput with a new option. The tput utility
           does not support setting or clearing tabs, and no known
           historical version of tabs supports the capability of setting
           arbitrary tab stops.
           The System V tabs interface is very complex; the version in this
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017 has a reduced feature list, but many of
           the features omitted were restored as part of the XSI option even
           though the supported languages and coding styles are primarily
           historical.
           There was considerable sentiment for specifying only a means of
           resetting the tabs back to a known state—presumably the
           ``standard'' of tabs every eight positions. The following
           features were omitted:
            *  Setting tab stops via the first line in a file, using --file.
               Since even the SVID has no complete explanation of this
               feature, it is doubtful that it is in widespread use.
           In an early proposal, a -t tablist option was added for
           consistency with expand; this was later removed when
           inconsistencies with the historical list of tabs were identified.
           Consideration was given to adding a -p option that would output
           the current tab settings so that they could be saved and then
           later restored. This was not accepted because querying the tab
           stops of the terminal is not a capability in historical terminfo
           or termcap facilities and might not be supported on a wide range
           of terminals.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
