    CHFN(1)                       User Commands                      CHFN(1)
## NAME         top
           chfn - change real user name and information
## SYNOPSIS         top
           chfn [options] [LOGIN]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The chfn command changes user fullname, office room number,
           office phone number, and home phone number information for a
           user's account. This information is typically printed by
           finger(1) and similar programs. A normal user may only change the
           fields for her own account, subject to the restrictions in
           /etc/login.defs. (The default configuration is to prevent users
           from changing their fullname.) The superuser may change any field
           for any account. Additionally, only the superuser may use the -o
           option to change the undefined portions of the GECOS field.
           These fields must not contain any colons. Except for the other
           field, they should not contain any comma or equal sign. It is
           also recommended to avoid non-US-ASCII characters, but this is
           only enforced for the phone numbers. The other field is used to
           store accounting information used by other applications.
## OPTIONS         top
           The options which apply to the chfn command are:
           -f, --full-name FULL_NAME
               Change the user's full name.
           -h, --home-phone HOME_PHONE
               Change the user's home phone number.
           -o, --other OTHER
               Change the user's other GECOS information. This field is used
               to store accounting information used by other applications,
               and can be changed only by a superuser.
           -r, --room ROOM_NUMBER
               Change the user's room number.
           -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
               Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the
               configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR directory. Only
               absolute paths are supported.
           -u, --help
               Display help message and exit.
           -w, --work-phone WORK_PHONE
               Change the user's office phone number.
           If none of the options are selected, chfn operates in an
           interactive fashion, prompting the user with the current values
           for all of the fields. Enter the new value to change the field,
           or leave the line blank to use the current value. The current
           value is displayed between a pair of [ ] marks. Without options,
           chfn prompts for the current user account.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
           the behavior of this tool:
           CHFN_RESTRICT (string)
               This parameter specifies which values in the gecos field of
               the /etc/passwd file may be changed by regular users using
               the chfn program. It can be any combination of letters f, r,
               w, h, for Full name, Room number, Work phone, and Home phone,
               respectively. For backward compatibility, yes is equivalent
               to rwh and no is equivalent to frwh. If not specified, only
               the superuser can make any changes. The most restrictive
               setting is better achieved by not installing chfn SUID.
## FILES         top
           /etc/login.defs
               Shadow password suite configuration.
           /etc/passwd
               User account information.
## SEE ALSO         top
           chsh(1), login.defs(5), passwd(5).
