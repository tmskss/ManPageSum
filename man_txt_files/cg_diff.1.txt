    CG_DIFF(1)                       cg_diff                      CG_DIFF(1)
## NAME         top
           cg_diff - (deprecated) diffs two Cachegrind output files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cg_diff [options] cachegrind-out-file1 cachegrind-out-file2
## DESCRIPTION         top
           cg_diff diffs two Cachegrind output files into a single
           Cachegrind output file. It is deprecated because cg_annotate can
           now do much the same thing, but better.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h --help
               Show the help message.
           --version
               Show the version number.
           --mod-filename=<expr> [default: none]
               Specifies an s/old/new/ search-and-replace expression that is
               applied to all filenames.
           --mod-funcname=<expr> [default: none]
               Like --mod-filename, but for filenames.
