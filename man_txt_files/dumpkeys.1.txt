    DUMPKEYS(1)              General Commands Manual             DUMPKEYS(1)
## NAME         top
           dumpkeys - dump keyboard translation tables
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dumpkeys [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dumpkeys writes, to the standard output, the current contents of
           the keyboard driver's translation tables, in the format specified
           by keymaps(5).
           Using the various options, the format of the output can be
           controlled and also other information from the kernel and the
           programs dumpkeys(1) and loadkeys(1) can be obtained.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h --help
                  Prints the program's version number and a short usage
                  message to the program's standard error output and exits.
           -i --short-info
                  Prints some characteristics of the kernel's keyboard
                  driver. The items shown are:
                  Keycode range supported by the kernel
                         This tells what values can be used after the
                         keycode keyword in keytable files. See keymaps(5)
                         for more information and the syntax of these files.
                  Number of actions bindable to a key
                         This tells how many different actions a single key
                         can output using various modifier keys. If the
                         value is 16 for example, you can define up to 16
                         different actions to a key combined with modifiers.
                         When the value is 16, the kernel probably knows
                         about four modifier keys, which you can press in
                         different combinations with the key to access all
                         the bound actions.
                  Ranges of action codes supported by the kernel
                         This item contains a list of action code ranges in
                         hexadecimal notation.  These are the values that
                         can be used in the right hand side of a key
                         definition, ie. the vv's in a line
                                keycode xx = vv vv vv vv
                         (see keymaps(5) for more information about the
                         format of key definition lines).  dumpkeys(1) and
                         loadkeys(1) support a symbolic notation, which is
                         preferable to the numeric one, as the action codes
                         may vary from kernel to kernel while the symbolic
                         names usually remain the same. However, the list of
                         action code ranges can be used to determine, if the
                         kernel actually supports all the symbols
                         loadkeys(1) knows, or are there maybe some actions
                         supported by the kernel that have no symbolic name
                         in your loadkeys(1) program. To see this, you
                         compare the range list with the action symbol list,
                         see option --long-info below.
                  Number of function keys supported by kernel
                         This tells the number of action codes that can be
                         used to output strings of characters. These action
                         codes are traditionally bound to the various
                         function and editing keys of the keyboard and are
                         defined to send standard escape sequences. However,
                         you can redefine these to send common command
                         lines, email addresses or whatever you like.
                         Especially if the number of this item is greater
                         than the number of function and editing keys in
                         your keyboard, you may have some "spare" action
                         codes that you can bind to AltGr-letter
                         combinations, for example, to send some useful
                         strings. See loadkeys(1) for more details.
                  Function strings
                         You can see you current function key definitions
                         with the command
                                dumpkeys --funcs-only
           -l -s --long-info
                  This option instructs dumpkeys to print a long information
                  listing. The output is the same as with the --short-info
                  appended with the list of action symbols supported by
                  loadkeys(1) and dumpkeys(1), along with the symbols'
                  numeric values.
           -n --numeric
                  This option causes dumpkeys to by-pass the conversion of
                  action code values to symbolic notation and to print the
                  in hexadecimal format instead.
           -f --full-table
                  This makes dumpkeys skip all the short-hand heuristics
                  (see keymaps(5)) and output the key bindings in the
                  canonical form. First a keymaps line describing the
                  currently defined modifier combinations is printed. Then
                  for each key a row with a column for each modifier
                  combination is printed. For example, if the current keymap
                  in use uses seven modifiers, every row will have seven
                  action code columns. This format can be useful for example
                  to programs that post-process the output of dumpkeys.
           -Sshape  --shape=shape
                  Available shapes:
                  2 default output.
                  4 one line for each keycode.
                  8 one line for each (modifier,keycode) pair.
                  16 one line for each keycode until 1st hole.
           -1 --separate-lines
                  This forces dumpkeys to write one line per
                  (modifier,keycode) pair. It prefixes the word plain for
                  plain keycodes.
           -t --funcs-only
                  When this option is given, dumpkeys prints only the
                  function key string definitions. Normally dumpkeys prints
                  both the key bindings and the string definitions.
           -k --keys-only
                  When this option is given, dumpkeys prints only the key
                  bindings. Normally dumpkeys prints both the key bindings
                  and the string definitions.
           -d --compose-only
                  When this option is given, dumpkeys prints only the
                  compose key combinations.  This option is available only
                  if your kernel has compose key support.
           -ccharset  --charset=charset
                  This instructs dumpkeys to interpret character code values
                  according to the specified character set. This affects
                  only the translation of character code values to symbolic
                  names. Valid values for charset currently are iso-8859-X,
                  Where X is a digit in 1-9.  If no charset is specified,
                  iso-8859-1 is used as a default.  This option produces an
                  output line `charset "iso-8859-X"', telling loadkeys how
                  to interpret the keymap. (For example, "division" is 0xf7
                  in iso-8859-1 but 0xba in iso-8859-8.)
           -Cdev  --console=dev
                  The affected console device can be specified using the -C
                  (or --console ) option. This option supports exactly one
                  device name.
           -v --verbose
                  Turn on verbose output.
           -V --version
                  Prints version number and exits.
