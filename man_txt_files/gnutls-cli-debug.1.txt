## NAME         top
           gnutls-cli-debug - GnuTLS debug client
## SYNOPSIS         top
           gnutls-cli-debug [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=|
           ]value]] [hostname]
           Operands and options may be intermixed.  They will be reordered.
## DESCRIPTION         top
           TLS debug client. It sets up multiple TLS connections to a server
           and queries its capabilities. It was created to assist in
           debugging GnuTLS, but it might be useful to extract a TLS
           server's capabilities.  It connects to a TLS server, performs
           tests and print the server's capabilities. If called with the
           `-V' parameter more checks will be performed.  Can be used to
           check for servers with special needs or bugs.
## OPTIONS         top
           -d num, --debug=num
                  Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as
                  its argument.  The value of num is constrained to being:
                      in the range 0 through 9999
                  Specifies the debug level.
           -V, --verbose
                  More verbose output.
           -p num, --port=num
                  The port to connect to.  This option takes an integer
                  number as its argument.  The value of num is constrained
                  to being:
                      in the range 0 through 65536
           --app-proto
                  This is an alias for the --starttls-proto option.
           --starttls-proto=str
                  The application protocol to be used to obtain the server's
                  certificate (https, ftp, smtp, imap, ldap, xmpp, lmtp,
                  pop3, nntp, sieve, postgres).
                  Specify the application layer protocol for STARTTLS. If
                  the protocol is supported, gnutls-cli will proceed to the
                  TLS negotiation.
           -v arg, --version=arg
                  Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is
                  `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright
                  information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.
           -h, --help
                  Display usage information and exit.
           -!, --more-help
                  Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
