## NAME         top
           pmpost - append messages to the Performance Co-Pilot notice board
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmpost message
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmpost will append the text message to the end of the Performance
           Co-Pilot (PCP) notice board file ($PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES) in an
           atomic manner that guards against corruption of the notice board
           file by concurrent invocations of pmpost.
           The PCP notice board is intended to be a persistent store and
           clearing house for important messages relating to the operation
           of the PCP and the notification of performance alerts from
           pmie(1) when other notification options are either unavailable or
           unsuitable.
           Before being written, messages are prefixed by the current time,
           and when the current day is different to the last time the notice
           board file was written, pmpost will prepend the message with the
           full date.
           If the notice board file does not exist, pmpost will create it.
           pmpost would usually run from long-running PCP daemons executing
           under the (typically unprivileged) $PCP_USER and $PCP_GROUP
           accounts.  The file should be owned and writable by the $PCP_USER
           user, and readable by others.
