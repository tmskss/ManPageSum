## NAME         top
           pcp-free - report on free and used memory in the system
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] free [-bkmgroltVw?]  [-c count] [-s interval]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-free gives a summary display of the total amount of free and
           used physical memory and swap in the system, as well as the
           caches used by the kernel.
           When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
           -O/--origin, -s/--samples, -t/--interval, -Z/--timezone and
           several other pcp options become indirectly available, see
           PCPIntro(1) for their descriptions.
           The displayed columns are:
           total  Total installed memory (MemTotal and SwapTotal in
                  /proc/meminfo)
           used   Used memory (calculated as total - free - buffers - cache)
           free   Unused memory (MemFree and SwapFree in /proc/meminfo)
           shared Memory used (mostly) by tmpfs (Shmem in /proc/meminfo)
           buffers
                  Memory used by kernel buffers (Buffers in /proc/meminfo)
           cache  Memory used by the page cache and slabs (Cached and
                  SReclaimable in /proc/meminfo)
           buff/cache
                  Sum of buffers and cache
           available
                  Estimation of how much memory is available for starting
                  new applications, without swapping.  Unlike the data
                  provided by the cache or free fields, this field takes
                  into account page cache and also that not all reclaimable
                  memory slabs will be reclaimed due to items being in use
                  (MemAvailable in /proc/meminfo).
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -b, --bytes
                Display the amount of memory in bytes.
           -c count, --samples=count, --count=count
                Terminate the display after count iterations.  See also -s.
           -g, --gigabytes
                Display the amount of memory in gigabytes.
           -k, --kilobytes
                Display the amount of memory in kilobytes.  This is the
                default.
           -l, --lohi
                Display detailed low and high memory statistics.
           -m, --megabytes
                Display the amount of memory in megabytes.
           -o   Disable the display of a "buffer adjusted" line.  If the -o
                option is not specified, free subtracts buffer memory from
                the used memory and adds it to the free memory reported.
           -r, --terabytes
                Display the amount of memory in terabytes.
           -s delay, --interval=delay, --seconds=delay
                Activate continuous polling delay seconds apart.  You may
                specify any floating point number for delay, or indeed any
                valid pmParseInterval(3) specification, which includes
                microsecond resolution delay times.  This can be used in
                conjunction with the -c option.
           -t, --total
                Display a line containing the totals.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -w, --wide
                Switch to the wide mode.  The wide mode produces lines
                longer than 80 characters.  In this mode buffers and cache
                are reported in two separate columns.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## NOTES         top
           pcp-free is inspired by the free(1) command and aims to be
           command line and output compatible with it.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
