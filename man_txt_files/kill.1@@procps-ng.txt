    KILL(1)                       User Commands                      KILL(1)
## NAME         top
           kill - send a signal to a process
## SYNOPSIS         top
           kill [options] <pid> [...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The default signal for kill is TERM.  Use -l or -L to list
           available signals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT,
           KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.  Alternate signals may be specified in
           three ways: -9, -SIGKILL or -KILL.  Negative PID values may be
           used to choose whole process groups; see the PGID column in ps
           command output.  A PID of -1 is special; it indicates all
           processes except the kill process itself and init.
## OPTIONS         top
           <pid> [...]
                  Send signal to every <pid> listed.
           -<signal>
           -s <signal>
           --signal <signal>
                  Specify the signal to be sent.  The signal can be
                  specified by using name or number.  The behavior of
                  signals is explained in signal(7) manual page.
           -q, --queue value
                  Use sigqueue(3) rather than kill(2) and the value argument
                  is used to specify an integer to be sent with the signal.
                  If the receiving process has installed a handler for this
                  signal using the SA_SIGINFO flag to sigaction(2), then it
                  can obtain this data via the si_value field of the
                  siginfo_t structure.
           -l, --list [signal]
                  List signal names.  This option has optional argument,
                  which will convert signal number to signal name, or other
                  way round.
           -L, --table
                  List signal names in a nice table.
## NOTES         top
                  Your shell (command line interpreter) may have a built-in
                  kill command.  You may need to run the command described
                  here as /bin/kill to solve the conflict.
## EXAMPLES         top
           kill -9 -1
                  Kill all processes you can kill.
           kill -l 11
                  Translate number 11 into a signal name.
           kill -L
                  List the available signal choices in a nice table.
           kill 123 543 2341 3453
                  Send the default signal, SIGTERM, to all those processes.
## SEE ALSO         top
           kill(2), killall(1), nice(1), pkill(1), renice(1), signal(7),
           sigqueue(3), skill(1)
## STANDARDS         top
           This command meets appropriate standards. The -L flag is Linux-
           specific.
## AUTHOR         top
           Albert Cahalan ⟨albert@users.sf.net⟩ wrote kill in 1999 to
           replace a bsdutils one that was not standards compliant.  The
           util-linux one might also work correctly.
