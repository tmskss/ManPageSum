## NAME         top
           pon, poff, plog - starts up, shuts down or lists the log of PPP
           connections
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pon [ isp-name [ options ] ]
           poff [ -r ] [ -d ] [ -c ] [ -a ] [ -h ] [ isp-name ]
           plog [ arguments ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This manual page describes the pon, plog and poff scripts, which
           allow users to control PPP connections.
       pon
           pon, invoked without arguments, runs the /etc/ppp/ppp_on_boot
           file, if it exists and is executable. Otherwise, a PPP connection
           will be started using configuration from /etc/ppp/peers/provider.
           This is the default behaviour unless an isp-name argument is
           given.
           For instance, to use ISP configuration "myisp" run:
                  pon myisp
           pon will then use the options file /etc/ppp/peers/myisp.  You can
           pass additional options after the ISP name, too.  pon can be used
           to run multiple, simultaneous PPP connections.
       poff
           poff closes a PPP connection. If more than one PPP connection
           exists, the one named in the argument to poff will be killed,
           e.g.
                  poff myprovider2
           will terminate the connection to myprovider2, and leave the PPP
           connections to e.g. "myprovider1" or "myprovider3" up and
           running.
           poff takes the following command line options:
                  -r     causes the connection to be redialed after it is
                         dropped.
                  -d     toggles the state of pppd's debug option.
                  -c     causes pppd(8) to renegotiate compression.
                  -a     stops all running ppp connections. If the argument
                         isp-name is given it will be ignored.
                  -h     displays help information.
                  -v     prints the version and exits.
                  If no argument is given, poff will stop or signal pppd if
                  and only if there is exactly one running. If more than one
                  connection is active, it will exit with an error code of
                  1.
       plog
           plog shows you the last few lines of /var/log/ppp.log. If that
           file doesn't exist, it shows you the last few lines of your
           /var/log/syslog file, but excluding the lines not generated by
           pppd.  This script makes use of the tail(1) command, so arguments
           that can be passed to tail(1) can also be passed to plog.
           Note: the plog script can only be used by root or another system
           administrator in group "adm", due to security reasons. Also, to
           have all pppd-generated information in one logfile, that plog can
           show, you need the following line in your /etc/syslog.conf file:
           local2.*       -/var/log/ppp.log
## FILES         top
           /etc/ppp/options
                  PPPd system options file.
           /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
                  System PAP passwords file.
           /etc/ppp/chap-secrets
                  System CHAP passwords file.
           /etc/ppp/peers/
                  Directory holding the peer options files. The default file
                  is called provider.
           /etc/chatscripts/provider
                  The chat script invoked from the default
                  /etc/ppp/peers/provider.
           /var/log/ppp.log
                  The default PPP log file.
