## NAME         top
           flatpak-document-unexport - Stop exporting a file
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak document-unexport [OPTION...] FILE
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Removes the document id for the file from the document portal.
           This will make the document unavailable to all sandboxed
           applications.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           --doc-id
               Interpret FILE as a document ID rather than a file path. This
               is useful for example when the file has been deleted.
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
