## NAME         top
           mv - move (rename) files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           mv [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
           mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
           mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Rename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           --backup[=CONTROL]
                  make a backup of each existing destination file
           -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument
           --debug
                  explain how a file is copied.  Implies -v
           -f, --force
                  do not prompt before overwriting
           -i, --interactive
                  prompt before overwrite
           -n, --no-clobber
                  do not overwrite an existing file
           If you specify more than one of -i, -f, -n, only the final one
           takes effect.
           --no-copy
                  do not copy if renaming fails
           --strip-trailing-slashes
                  remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument
           -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
                  override the usual backup suffix
           -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
                  move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY
           -T, --no-target-directory
                  treat DEST as a normal file
           --update[=UPDATE]
                  control which existing files are updated;
                  UPDATE={all,none,older(default)}.  See below
           -u     equivalent to --update[=older]
           -v, --verbose
                  explain what is being done
           -Z, --context
                  set SELinux security context of destination file to
                  default type
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           UPDATE controls which existing files in the destination are
           replaced.  'all' is the default operation when an --update option
           is not specified, and results in all existing files in the
           destination being replaced.  'none' is similar to the
           --no-clobber option, in that no files in the destination are
           replaced, but also skipped files do not induce a failure.
           'older' is the default operation when --update is specified, and
           results in files being replaced if they're older than the
           corresponding source file.
           The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or
           SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected
           via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL
           environment variable.  Here are the values:
           none, off
                  never make backups (even if --backup is given)
           numbered, t
                  make numbered backups
           existing, nil
                  numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
           simple, never
                  always make simple backups
