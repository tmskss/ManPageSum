## NAME         top
           pmdamemcache - memcached performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This PMDA extracts performance data from memcached, a distributed
           memory caching daemon commonly used to improve web serving
           performance.  A farm of memcached processes over multiple servers
           can be utilised by a single web application, increasing the total
           available object cache size, and decreasing the database load
           associated with smaller cache sizes.  This system is described in
           detail at http://www.danga.com/memcached .
## INSTALLATION         top
           Configure pmdamemcache to extract the values from set of hosts
           used in the memcache farm.  These hosts can be listed in the
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/memcache/memcache.conf file, in the format (i.e.
           Perl array) described at the top of pmdamemcache.pl.  A custom
           refresh rate can also be configured using this mechanism.
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/memcache
                # [ edit memcache.conf ]
           Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
           memcache performance metrics by doing the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/memcache
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/memcache
                # ./Remove
           pmdamemcache is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/memcache/memcache.conf
               optional configuration file listing monitored memcache
               instances
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/memcache/Install
               installation script for the pmdamemcache agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/memcache/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdamemcache agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/memcache.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdamemcache
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
