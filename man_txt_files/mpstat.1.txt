    MPSTAT(1)                  Linux User's Manual                 MPSTAT(1)
## NAME         top
           mpstat - Report processors related statistics.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           mpstat [ -A ] [ --dec={ 0 | 1 | 2 } ] [ -H ] [ -n ] [ -u ] [ -T ]
           [ -V ] [ -I { keyword[,...] | ALL } ] [ -N { node_list | ALL } ]
           [ -o JSON ] [ -P { cpu_list | ALL } ] [ interval [ count ] ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The mpstat command writes to standard output activities for each
           available processor, processor 0 being the first one.  Global
           average activities among all processors are also reported.  The
           mpstat command can be used on both SMP and UP machines, but in
           the latter, only global average activities will be printed. If no
           activity has been selected, then the default report is the CPU
           utilization report.
           The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
           between each report.  A value of 0 (or no parameters at all)
           indicates that processors statistics are to be reported for the
           time since system startup (boot). The count parameter can be
           specified in conjunction with the interval parameter if this one
           is not set to zero. The value of count determines the number of
           reports generated at interval seconds apart. If the interval
           parameter is specified without the count parameter, the mpstat
           command generates reports continuously.
## OPTIONS         top
           -A     This option is equivalent to specifying -n -u -I ALL.
                  This option also implies specifying -N ALL -P ALL unless
                  these options are explicitly set on the command line.
           --dec={ 0 | 1 | 2 }
                  Specify the number of decimal places to use (0 to 2,
                  default value is 2).
           -H     Also detect and display statistics for physically
                  hotplugged vCPUs.
           -I { keyword[,...] | ALL }
                  Report interrupts statistics.  Possible keywords are CPU,
                  SCPU, and SUM.
                  With the CPU keyword, the number of each individual
                  interrupt received per second by the CPU or CPUs is
                  displayed. Interrupts are those listed in /proc/interrupts
                  file.
                  With the SCPU keyword, the number of each individual
                  software interrupt received per second by the CPU or CPUs
                  is displayed. This option works only with kernels 2.6.31
                  and later. Software interrupts are those listed in
                  /proc/softirqs file.
                  With the SUM keyword, the mpstat command reports the total
                  number of interrupts per processor.  The following values
                  are displayed:
                  CPU    Processor number. The keyword all indicates that
                         statistics are calculated as averages among all
                         processors.
                  intr/s Show the total number of interrupts received per
                         second by the CPU or CPUs.
                  The ALL keyword is equivalent to specifying all the
                  keywords above and therefore all the interrupts statistics
                  are displayed.
           -N { node_list | ALL }
                  Indicate the NUMA nodes for which statistics are to be
                  reported.  node_list is a list of comma-separated values
                  or range of values (e.g., 0,2,4-7,12-). Note that node all
                  is the global average among all nodes. The ALL keyword
                  indicates that statistics are to be reported for all
                  nodes.
           -n     Report summary CPU statistics based on NUMA node
                  placement. The following values are displayed:
                  NODE   Logical NUMA node number. The keyword all indicates
                         that statistics are calculated as averages among
                         all nodes.
                  All the other fields are the same as those displayed with
                  option -u (see below).
           -o JSON
                  Display the statistics in JSON (JavaScript Object
                  Notation) format.  JSON output field order is undefined,
                  and new fields may be added in the future.
           -P { cpu_list | ALL }
                  Indicate the processors for which statistics are to be
                  reported.  cpu_list is a list of comma-separated values or
                  range of values (e.g., 0,2,4-7,12-).  Note that processor
                  0 is the first processor, and processor all is the global
                  average among all processors.  The ALL keyword indicates
                  that statistics are to be reported for all processors.
                  Offline processors are not displayed.
           -T     Display topology elements in the CPU report (see option -u
                  below). The following elements are displayed:
                  CORE   Logical core number.
                  SOCK   Logical socket number.
                  NODE   Logical NUMA node number.
           -u     Report CPU utilization. The following values are
                  displayed:
                  CPU    Processor number. The keyword all indicates that
                         statistics are calculated as averages among all
                         processors.
                  %usr   Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
                         occurred while executing at the user level
                         (application).
                  %nice  Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
                         occurred while executing at the user level with
                         nice priority.
                  %sys   Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
                         occurred while executing at the system level
                         (kernel). Note that this does not include time
                         spent servicing hardware and software interrupts.
                  %iowait
                         Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs
                         were idle during which the system had an
                         outstanding disk I/O request.
                  %irq   Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                         CPUs to service hardware interrupts.
                  %soft  Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                         CPUs to service software interrupts.
                  %steal Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary
                         wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the
                         hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.
                  %guest Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                         CPUs to run a virtual processor.
                  %gnice Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                         CPUs to run a niced guest.
                  %idle  Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs
                         were idle and the system did not have an
                         outstanding disk I/O request.
           -V     Print version number then exit.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           The mpstat command takes into account the following environment
           variable:
           S_COLORS
                  By default statistics are displayed in color when the
                  output is connected to a terminal.  Use this variable to
                  change the settings. Possible values for this variable are
                  never, always or auto (the latter is equivalent to the
                  default settings).
                  Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some
                  other color) used to display a value is not indicative of
                  any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only
                  indicates different ranges of values.
           S_COLORS_SGR
                  Specify the colors and other attributes used to display
                  statistics on the terminal.  Its value is a colon-
                  separated list of capabilities that defaults to
                  I=32;22:N=34;1:W=35;1:X=31;1:Z=34;22.  Supported
                  capabilities are:
                  I=     SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for CPU
                         number.
                  N=     SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.
                  W= (or M=)
                         SGR substring for percentage values in the range
                         from 75% to 90% (or in the range 10% to 25%
                         depending on the metric's meaning).
                  X= (or H=)
                         SGR substring for percentage values greater than or
                         equal to 90% (or lower than or equal to 10%
                         depending on the metric's meaning).
                  Z=     SGR substring for zero values.
           S_TIME_FORMAT
                  If this variable exists and its value is ISO then the
                  current locale will be ignored when printing the date in
                  the report header.  The mpstat command will use the ISO
                  8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp will also
                  be compliant with ISO 8601 format.
## EXAMPLES         top
           mpstat 2 5
                  Display five reports of global statistics among all
                  processors at two second intervals.
           mpstat -P ALL 2 5
                  Display five reports of statistics for all processors at
                  two second intervals.
## BUGS         top
           /proc filesystem must be mounted for the mpstat command to work.
## FILES         top
           /proc contains various files with system statistics.
