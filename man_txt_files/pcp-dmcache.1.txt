## NAME         top
           pcp-dmcache, pcp-lvmcache - report on logical storage device
           caches
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] dmcache [-iRV?] [device ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-dmcache reports on the activity of any configured Device
           Mapper Cache targets.  The reported information includes device
           IOPs, cache and metadata device utilization, as well as hit and
           miss rates and ratios for both reads and writes for each cache
           device.
           pcp-lvmcache (Logical Volume Manager cache) is an exact synonym
           for pcp-dmcache (Device Mapper cache).
           By default, pcp-dmcache reports on all available cache target
           devices (one line each, per sample), but this can be restricted
           to specific devices on the command line.
## OPTIONS         top
           When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
           -O/--origin, -s/--samples, -t/--interval, -Z/--timezone and
           several other pcp options become indirectly available; refer to
           PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of these options.
           The additional command line options available for pcp-dmcache
           are:
           -i, --iops
                  displays total read and write operations instead of the
                  default cache hit ratio.
           -R, --repeat
                  changes the frequency at which the column heading is
                  displayed.  By default, a header is displayed after every
                  tenth sample.
           -V, --version
                  Display version number and exit.
           -?, --help
                  Display usage message and exit.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
