## NAME         top
           stap-jupyter-install   - locally install isystemtap
           stap-jupyter-container - manage an isystemtap container image
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stap-jupyter-install [--remove] [--container-install PREFIX]
           stap-jupyter-container [--repo REPOSITORY] [--image IMAGE] [--tag
           TAG] [--keyname KEYNAME] --{run, pull, build, publish, remove}
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ISystemtap is an interactive jupyter interface for the
           incremental writing and running of Systemtap scripts.
           The stap-jupyter-install program can be used to locally install
           the ISystemtap jupyter kernel, language-server and jupyter-lab
           extension in ~/.systemtap/jupyter.  Once installed, the kernel
           can be used with jupyter-lab.
           Alternatively the stap-jupyter-container program can be used to
           run ISystemtap within a container, preventing the need for any
           local jupyter kernel installation.
## INSTALL OPTIONS         top
           The following options are supported by stap-jupyter-install. Any
           other option prints a short help message.
           --remove
                  Uninstall the local ISystemtap files.
           --container-install PREFIX
                  [Intended For Maintainers Only] This is used to specify
                  the PREFIX of the install directory for stap. It is called
                  within the container build process, and should not be used
                  otherwise.
## CONTAINER OPTIONS         top
           The following options are supported by stap-jupyter-container.
           Any other option prints a short help message.
           --repo REPOSITORY
                  Specify which repository to use, defaults to "quay.io".
           --image IMAGE
                  Specify the image name. Defaults to "systemtap/isystemtap"
           --tag TAG
                  Specify the image tag. Defaults to "latest"
           --keyname KEYNAME
                  In order for the container to run stap it needs to ssh to
                  the host. It requires an ssh key pair, and is specified by
                  KEYNAME, which is by default "id_rsa".
## CONTAINER COMMANDS         top
           The following commands are recognized by stap-jupyter-container.
           One of the following is required.
           --run
                   Run the image. Pulls if not done already.
           --pull
                   Pulls the image.
           --build
                   Builds a local copy of the image. The repo will be
                  "localhost". See podman images.
           --remove
                   Removes the image.
           --publish
                   [Intended For Maintainers Only] This is used to publish
                  the built image. It requires write permissions to
                  https://quay.io/systemtap/isystemtap.
