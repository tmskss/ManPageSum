## NAME         top
           apropos - search the manual page names and descriptions
## SYNOPSIS         top
           apropos [-dalv?V] [-e|-w|-r] [-s list] [-m system[,...]] [-M
           path] [-L locale] [-C file] keyword ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Each manual page has a short description available within it.
           apropos searches the descriptions for instances of keyword.
           keyword is usually a regular expression, as if (-r) was used, or
           may contain wildcards (-w), or match the exact keyword (-e).
           Using these options, it may be necessary to quote the keyword or
           escape (\) the special characters to stop the shell from
           interpreting them.
           The standard matching rules allow matches to be made against the
           page name and word boundaries in the description.
           The database searched by apropos is updated by the mandb program.
           Depending on your installation, this may be run by a periodic
           cron job, or may need to be run manually after new manual pages
           have been installed.
## OPTIONS         top
           -d, --debug
                  Print debugging information.
           -v, --verbose
                  Print verbose warning messages.
           -r, --regex
                  Interpret each keyword as a regular expression.  This is
                  the default behaviour.  Each keyword will be matched
                  against the page names and the descriptions independently.
                  It can match any part of either.  The match is not limited
                  to word boundaries.
           -w, --wildcard
                  Interpret each keyword as a pattern containing shell style
                  wildcards.  Each keyword will be matched against the page
                  names and the descriptions independently.  If --exact is
                  also used, a match will only be found if an expanded
                  keyword matches an entire description or page name.
                  Otherwise the keyword is also allowed to match on word
                  boundaries in the description.
           -e, --exact
                  Each keyword will be exactly matched against the page
                  names and the descriptions.
           -a, --and
                  Only display items that match all the supplied keywords.
                  The default is to display items that match any keyword.
           -l, --long
                  Do not trim output to the terminal width.  Normally,
                  output will be truncated to the terminal width to avoid
                  ugly results from poorly-written NAME sections.
           -s list, --sections=list, --section=list
                  Search only the given manual sections.  list is a colon-
                  or comma-separated list of sections.  If an entry in list
                  is a simple section, for example "3", then the displayed
                  list of descriptions will include pages in sections "3",
                  "3perl", "3x", and so on; while if an entry in list has an
                  extension, for example "3perl", then the list will only
                  include pages in that exact part of the manual section.
           -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
                  If this system has access to other operating systems'
                  manual page descriptions, they can be searched using this
                  option.  To search NewOS's manual page descriptions, use
                  the option -m NewOS.
                  The system specified can be a combination of comma-
                  delimited operating system names.  To include a search of
                  the native operating system's whatis descriptions, include
                  the system name man in the argument string.  This option
                  will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.
           -M path, --manpath=path
                  Specify an alternate set of colon-delimited manual page
                  hierarchies to search.  By default, apropos uses the
                  $MANPATH environment variable, unless it is empty or
                  unset, in which case it will determine an appropriate
                  manpath based on your $PATH environment variable.  This
                  option overrides the contents of $MANPATH.
           -L locale, --locale=locale
                  apropos will normally determine your current locale by a
                  call to the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates
                  various environment variables, possibly including
                  $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the
                  determined value, use this option to supply a locale
                  string directly to apropos.  Note that it will not take
                  effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output
                  such as the help message will always be displayed in the
                  initially determined locale.
           -C file, --config-file=file
                  Use this user configuration file rather than the default
                  of ~/.manpath.
           -?, --help
                  Print a help message and exit.
           --usage
                  Print a short usage message and exit.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0      Successful program execution.
           1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.
           2      Operational error.
           16     Nothing was found that matched the criteria specified.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it
                  had been specified as the argument to the -m option.
           MANPATH
                  If $MANPATH is set, its value is interpreted as the colon-
                  delimited manual page hierarchy search path to use.
                  See the SEARCH PATH section of manpath(5) for the default
                  behaviour and details of how this environment variable is
                  handled.
           MANWIDTH
                  If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the terminal
                  width (see the --long option).  If it is not set, the
                  terminal width will be calculated using the value of
                  $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling back to 80
                  characters if all else fails.
           POSIXLY_CORRECT
                  If $POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, even to a null value, the
                  default apropos search will be as an extended regex (-r).
                  Nowadays, this is the default behaviour anyway.
