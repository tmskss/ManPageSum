## NAME         top
           pmdalogger - log file performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger/pmdalogger [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-m
           memory] [-s interval] [-U username] [configfile]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdalogger is a configurable log file monitoring Performance
           Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA).  It can be seen as analogous to the
           -f option to tail(1) and converts each new log line into a
           performance event.  It was the first PMDA to make extensive use
           of event metrics, which can be consumed by client tools like
           pmevent(1).
           The logger PMDA exports both event-style metrics reflecting
           timestamped event records for text logged to a file (or set of
           files or output from a process), as well as the more orthodox
           sample-style metrics such as event counts and throughput size
           values.
           The PMDA is configured via a configfile which contains one line
           for each source of events (file or process).  This file is setup
           by the Install script described in the later section on
           ``INSTALLATION'' of the PMDA.
           A brief description of the pmdalogger command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                logger.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdalogger is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
                log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -m   Limit the physical memory used by the PMDA to buffer event
                records to maxsize bytes.  As log events arrive at the PMDA,
                they must be buffered until individual client tools request
                the next batch since their previous batch of events.  The
                default maximum is 2 megabytes.
           -s   Sets the polling interval for detecting newly arrived log
                lines.  Mirrors the same option from the tail(1) command.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           logger performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger
                # ./Install
           This is an interactive installation process which prompts for
           each log file path to be monitored (or command to be run), a
           metric instance name to identify it, and whether access should be
           restricted (refer to the -x option to pmevent(1) for further
           details).
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger
                # ./Remove
           pmdalogger is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
