    FLATPAK(1)                       flatpak                      FLATPAK(1)
## NAME         top
           flatpak - Build, install and run applications and runtimes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak [OPTION...] {COMMAND}
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Flatpak is a tool for managing applications and the runtimes they
           use. In the Flatpak model, applications can be built and
           distributed independently from the host system they are used on,
           and they are isolated from the host system ('sandboxed') to some
           degree, at runtime.
           Flatpak can operate in system-wide or per-user mode. The
           system-wide data (runtimes, applications and configuration) is
           located in $prefix/var/lib/flatpak/, and the per-user data is in
           $HOME/.local/share/flatpak/. Below these locations, there is a
           local repository in the repo/ subdirectory and installed runtimes
           and applications are in the corresponding runtime/ and app/
           subdirectories.
           System-wide remotes can be statically preconfigured by dropping
           flatpakrepo files into /etc/flatpak/remotes.d/.
           In addition to the system-wide installation in
           $prefix/var/lib/flatpak/, which is always considered the default
           one unless overridden, more system-wide installations can be
           defined via configuration files in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/,
           which must define at least the id of the installation and the
           absolute path to it. Other optional parameters like DisplayName,
           Priority or StorageType are also supported.
           Flatpak uses OSTree to distribute and deploy data. The
           repositories it uses are OSTree repositories and can be
           manipulated with the ostree utility. Installed runtimes and
           applications are OSTree checkouts.
           Basic commands for building flatpaks such as build-init, build
           and build-finish are included in the flatpak utility. For
           higher-level build support, see the separate flatpak-builder(1)
           tool.
           Flatpak supports installing from sideload repos. These are
           partial copies of a repository (generated by flatpak create-usb)
           that are used as an installation source when offline (and online
           as a performance improvement). Such repositories are configured
           by creating symlinks to the sideload sources in the
           sideload-repos subdirectory of the installation directory (i.e.
           typically /var/lib/flatpak/sideload-repos or
           ~/.local/share/flatpak/sideload-repos). Additionally symlinks can
           be created in /run/flatpak/sideload-repos which is a better
           location for non-persistent sources (as it is cleared on reboot).
           These symlinks can point to either the directory given to flatpak
           create-usb which by default writes to the subpath .ostree/repo,
           or directly to an ostree repo.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following global options are understood. Individual commands
           have their own options.
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -v, --verbose
               Show debug information during command processing. Use -vv for
               more detail.
           --ostree-verbose
               Show OSTree debug information during command processing.
           --version
               Print version information and exit.
           --default-arch
               Print the default arch and exit.
           --supported-arches
               Print the supported arches in priority order and exit.
           --gl-drivers
               Print the list of active gl drivers and exit.
           --installations
               Print paths of system installations and exit.
           --print-system-only
               When the flatpak --print-updated-env command is run, only
               print the environment for system flatpak installations, not
               including the userâ€™s home installation.
           --print-updated-env
               Print the set of environment variables needed to use
               flatpaks, amending the current set of environment variables.
               This is intended to be used in a systemd environment
               generator, and should not need to be run manually.

## FILE FORMATS         top
           File formats that are used by Flatpak commands:
           flatpak-flatpakref(5)
               Reference to a remote for an application or runtime
           flatpak-flatpakrepo(5)
               Reference to a remote
           flatpak-remote(5)
               Configuration for a remote
           flatpak-installation(5)
               Configuration for an installation location
           flatpak-metadata(5)
               Information about an application or runtime
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           Besides standard environment variables such as XDG_DATA_DIRS and
           XDG_DATA_HOME, flatpak is consulting some of its own.
           FLATPAK_USER_DIR
               The location of the per-user installation. If this is not
               set, $XDG_DATA_HOME/flatpak is used.
           FLATPAK_SYSTEM_DIR
               The location of the default system-wide installation. If this
               is not set, /var/lib/flatpak is used (unless overridden at
               build time by --localstatedir or --with-system-install-dir).
           FLATPAK_SYSTEM_CACHE_DIR
               The location where temporary child repositories will be
               created during pulls into the system-wide installation. If
               this is not set, a directory in /var/tmp/ is used. This is
               useful because it is more likely to be on the same filesystem
               as the system repository (thus increasing the chances for
               e.g. reflink copying), and we can avoid filling the user's
               home directory with temporary data.
           FLATPAK_CONFIG_DIR
               The location of flatpak site configuration. If this is not
               set, /etc/flatpak is used (unless overridden at build time by
               --sysconfdir).
           FLATPAK_RUN_DIR
               The location of flatpak runtime global files. If this is not
               set, /run/flatpak is used.
