## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           pwd — return working directory name
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pwd [-L|-P]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The pwd utility shall write to standard output an absolute
           pathname of the current working directory, which does not contain
           the filenames dot or dot-dot.
## OPTIONS         top
           The pwd utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
           -L        If the PWD environment variable contains an absolute
                     pathname of the current directory and the pathname does
                     not contain any components that are dot or dot-dot, pwd
                     shall write this pathname to standard output, except
                     that if the PWD environment variable is longer than
                     {PATH_MAX} bytes including the terminating null, it is
                     unspecified whether pwd writes this pathname to
                     standard output or behaves as if the -P option had been
                     specified. Otherwise, the -L option shall behave as the
                     -P option.
           -P        The pathname written to standard output shall not
                     contain any components that refer to files of type
                     symbolic link. If there are multiple pathnames that the
                     pwd utility could write to standard output, one
                     beginning with a single <slash> character and one or
                     more beginning with two <slash> characters, then it
                     shall write the pathname beginning with a single
                     <slash> character. The pathname shall not contain any
                     unnecessary <slash> characters after the leading one or
                     two <slash> characters.
           If both -L and -P are specified, the last one shall apply. If
           neither -L nor -P is specified, the pwd utility shall behave as
           if -L had been specified.
## OPERANDS         top
           None.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           pwd:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
           PWD       An absolute pathname of the current working directory.
                     If an application sets or unsets the value of PWD, the
                     behavior of pwd is unspecified.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The pwd utility output is an absolute pathname of the current
           working directory:
               "%s\n", <directory pathname>
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           If an error is detected, output shall not be written to standard
           output, a diagnostic message shall be written to standard error,
           and the exit status is not zero.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           If the pathname obtained from pwd is longer than {PATH_MAX}
           bytes, it could produce an error if passed to cd.  Therefore, in
           order to return to that directory it may be necessary to break
           the pathname into sections shorter than {PATH_MAX} and call cd on
           each section in turn (the first section being an absolute
           pathname and subsequent sections being relative pathnames).
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           Some implementations have historically provided pwd as a shell
           special built-in command.
           In most utilities, if an error occurs, partial output may be
           written to standard output. This does not happen in historical
           implementations of pwd.  Because pwd is frequently used in
           historical shell scripts without checking the exit status, it is
           important that the historical behavior is required here;
           therefore, the CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section specifically
           disallows any partial output being written to standard output.
           An earlier version of this standard stated that the PWD
           environment variable was affected when the -P option was in
           effect. This was incorrect; conforming implementations do not do
           this.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
