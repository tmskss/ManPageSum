## NAME         top
           flatpak-search - Search for applications and runtimes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak search TEXT
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Searches for applications and runtimes matching TEXT. Note that
           this uses appstream data that can be updated with the flatpak
           update command. The appstream data is updated automatically only
           if it's at least a day old.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -u, --user
               Only search through remotes in the per-user installation.
           --system
               Only search through remotes in the default system-wide
               installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Show a system-wide installation by NAME among those defined
               in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.

           --columns=FIELD,...
               Specify what information to show about each result. You can
               list multiple fields, or use this option multiple times.
               Append :s[tart], :m[iddle], :e[nd] or :f[ull] to column names
               to change ellipsization.
