## NAME         top
           pmlogmv - move (rename) Performance Co-Pilot archive files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmlogmv [-cfNV?]  oldname newname
## DESCRIPTION         top
           A Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive consists of multiple files
           as created by pmlogger(1).  pmlogmv allows all the files of a
           single PCP archive to be moved or renamed as a group in a single
           operation.
           The oldname argument identifies the target archive, and may be
           either the basename that is common to all files in that archive
           or one of the archive's files.  The new archive's basename is
           newname.
           Because PCP archives are important records of system activity,
           special care is taken to ensure the integrity of an archive's
           files.  For recoverable problems encountered during the execution
           of pmlogmv, all the files associated with oldname will be
           preserved, and no new files with the newname prefix will be
           created.  ``Recoverable problems'' include signals that can be
           caught (such as SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM), permissions
           issues, new files already existing, file system full events, etc.
           The implementation of pmlogmv tries to use hard links in the file
           system and so follows the semantic restrictions of ln(2) which
           for most systems means the directories containing both the
           oldname and the newname PCP archive files need to be within the
           same file system.  When this is not possible, pmlogmv falls back
           to using cp(1) to copy oldname to newname.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -c, --checksum
                Paranoid checking mode when cp(1) is needed and each file's
                checksum is computed for the original file and the copied
                file, and the checksums must match before the copy is
                considered acceptable.  The checksum command is chosen by
                trying the following in turn until one is found to be
                executable: md5sum(1), sha256sum(1), sha1sum(1) and sum(1).
                If no executable checksum command is found, a warning is
                issued and the checksum check is skipped.
           -f, --force
                Normally pmlogmv takes a conservative view in respect of
                newname and will not proceed if newname contains any
                characters that are likely to cause a problem for sh(1).
                This includes ``glob'' characters like ``?'', ``*'' and
                ``['', shell syntax meta characters like ``('', ``|'', ``;''
                and ``&'', shell I/O redirection characters like ``<'' and
                ``>'', the dollar sign, a space, etc.
                The -f flag forces pmlogmv to proceed, even if newname
                contains any of these ``unsafe'' characters.
           -N, --showme
                Perform a dry-run, checking and reporting what changes would
                be made without making any changes.
           -V, --verbose
                Enable verbose mode.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           All error and warning messages are intended to be easily
           understood and errors produce a non-zero exit status.
## SEE ALSO         top
           cp(1), ln(1), md5sum(1), PCPIntro(1), pmlogger(1), sha1sum(1),
           sha256sum(1) and LOGARCHIVE(5).
