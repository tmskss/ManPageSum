## NAME         top
           dh_usrlocal - migrate usr/local directories to maintainer scripts
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_usrlocal [debhelper options] [-n]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_usrlocal is a debhelper program that can be used for building
           packages that will provide a subdirectory in /usr/local when
           installed.
           It finds subdirectories of usr/local in the package build
           directory, and removes them, replacing them with maintainer
           script snippets (unless -n is used) to create the directories at
           install time, and remove them when the package is removed, in a
           manner compliant with Debian policy. These snippets are inserted
           into the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb. See
           dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of debhelper maintainer
           script snippets.
           When the DEB_RULES_REQUIRES_ROOT environment variable is not
           (effectively) binary-targets, the directories in /usr/local will
           be handled as if they were owned by root:root (see below).
           When the DEB_RULES_REQUIRES_ROOT environment variable has an
           effective value of binary-targets, the owners, groups and
           permissions will be preserved with the sole exception where the
           directory is owned by root:root.
           If a directory is owned by root:root, then ownership will be
           determined at install time.  The ownership and permission bits
           will either be root:root mode 0755 or root:staff mode 02775.  The
           actual choice depends on whether the system has
           /etc/staff-group-for-usr-local (as documented in the Debian
           Policy Manual §9.1.2 since version 4.1.4)
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --no-scripts
               Do not modify postinst/prerm scripts.
## NOTES         top
           Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
           called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may
           cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
           maintainer scripts.
## CONFORMS TO         top
           Debian policy, version 2.2
## SEE ALSO         top
           debhelper(7)
           This program is a part of debhelper.
