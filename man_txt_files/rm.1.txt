## NAME         top
           rm - remove files or directories
## SYNOPSIS         top
           rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes
           each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.
           If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are
           more than three files or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given,
           then rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire
           operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire
           command is aborted.
           Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal,
           and the -f or --force option is not given, or the -i or
           --interactive=always option is given, rm prompts the user for
           whether to remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative,
           the file is skipped.
## OPTIONS         top
           Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).
           -f, --force
                  ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt
           -i     prompt before every removal
           -I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when
                  removing recursively; less intrusive than -i, while still
                  giving protection against most mistakes
           --interactive[=WHEN]
                  prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always
                  (-i); without WHEN, prompt always
           --one-file-system
                  when removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory
                  that is on a file system different from that of the
                  corresponding command line argument
           --no-preserve-root
                  do not treat '/' specially
           --preserve-root[=all]
                  do not remove '/' (default); with 'all', reject any
                  command line argument on a separate device from its parent
           -r, -R, --recursive
                  remove directories and their contents recursively
           -d, --dir
                  remove empty directories
           -v, --verbose
                  explain what is being done
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive
           (-r or -R) option to remove each listed directory, too, along
           with all of its contents.
           To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example
           '-foo', use one of these commands:
                  rm -- -foo
                  rm ./-foo
           Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to
           recover some of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or
           time.  For greater assurance that the contents are truly
           unrecoverable, consider using shred(1).
