    GIT-FMT-MERGE-MSG(1)           Git Manual           GIT-FMT-MERGE-MSG(1)
## NAME         top
           git-fmt-merge-msg - Produce a merge commit message
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git fmt-merge-msg [-m <message>] [--into-name <branch>] [--log[=<n>] | --no-log]
           git fmt-merge-msg [-m <message>] [--log[=<n>] | --no-log] -F <file>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Takes the list of merged objects on stdin and produces a suitable
           commit message to be used for the merge commit, usually to be
           passed as the <merge-message> argument of git merge.
           This command is intended mostly for internal use by scripts
           automatically invoking git merge.
## OPTIONS         top
           --log[=<n>]
               In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
               one-line descriptions from the actual commits that are being
               merged. At most <n> commits from each merge parent will be
               used (20 if <n> is omitted). This overrides the merge.log
               configuration variable.
           --no-log
               Do not list one-line descriptions from the actual commits
               being merged.
           --[no-]summary
               Synonyms to --log and --no-log; these are deprecated and will
               be removed in the future.
           -m <message>, --message <message>
               Use <message> instead of the branch names for the first line
               of the log message. For use with --log.
           --into-name <branch>
               Prepare the merge message as if merging to the branch
               <branch>, instead of the name of the real branch to which the
               merge is made.
           -F <file>, --file <file>
               Take the list of merged objects from <file> instead of stdin.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           merge.branchdesc
               In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
               the branch description text associated with them. Defaults to
               false.
           merge.log
               In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at
               most the specified number of one-line descriptions from the
               actual commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and
               true is a synonym for 20.
           merge.suppressDest
               By adding a glob that matches the names of integration
               branches to this multi-valued configuration variable, the
               default merge message computed for merges into these
               integration branches will omit "into <branch name>" from its
               title.
               An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list
               of globs accumulated from previous configuration entries.
               When there is no merge.suppressDest variable defined, the
               default value of master is used for backward compatibility.
           merge.summary
               Synonym to merge.log; this is deprecated and will be removed
               in the future.
## EXAMPLES         top
               $ git fetch origin master
               $ git fmt-merge-msg --log <$GIT_DIR/FETCH_HEAD
           Print a log message describing a merge of the "master" branch
           from the "origin" remote.
