## NAME         top
           wc - print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
## SYNOPSIS         top

## DESCRIPTION         top
           Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total
           line if more than one FILE is specified.  A word is a
           non-zero-length sequence of printable characters delimited by
           white space.
           With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
           The options below may be used to select which counts are printed,
           always in the following order: newline, word, character, byte,
           maximum line length.
           -c, --bytes
                  print the byte counts
           -m, --chars
                  print the character counts
           -l, --lines
                  print the newline counts
           --files0-from=F
                  read input from the files specified by NUL-terminated
                  names in file F; If F is - then read names from standard
                  input
           -L, --max-line-length
                  print the maximum display width
           -w, --words
                  print the word counts
           --total=WHEN
                  when to print a line with total counts; WHEN can be: auto,
                  always, only, never
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
