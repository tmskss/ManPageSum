## NAME         top
           stg-sink - Move patches deeper in the stack
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg sink [OPTIONS] [patch]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Move the specified patches down the stack.
           If no patch is specified on the command line, the current
           (topmost) patch is sunk. By default, patches are sunk to the
           bottom of the stack, but the --to option may be used to place
           them under any applied patch.
           Internally, sinking involves popping all patches to the bottom
           (or to the target patch if --to is used), then pushing the
           patches to sink, and then, unless --nopush is specified, pushing
           back any other formerly applied patches.
           Sinking may be useful, for example, to group stable patches at
           the bottom of the stack where they less likely to be impacted by
           the push of another patch, and from where they can be more easily
           committed or pushed to another repository.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --nopush
               Do not push any formerly applied patches after sinking. Only
               the patches to sink are pushed.
           -t <target>, --to=<target>
               Sink patches below <target> patch.
               Specified patches are placed below <target> instead of at the
               bottom of the stack.
           -k, --keep
               Keep the local changes
           --committer-date-is-author-date
               Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
               the author date of the commit as the committer date.
