           ldapwhoami [-V[V]] [-d debuglevel] [-n] [-v] [-x] [-D binddn]
           [-W] [-w passwd] [-y passwdfile] [-H ldapuri]
           [-e [!]ext[=extparam]] [-E [!]ext[=extparam]] [-o opt[=optparam]]

## DESCRIPTION         top
           ldapwhoami implements the LDAP "Who Am I?" extended operation.
           ldapwhoami opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and
           performs a whoami operation.
## OPTIONS         top
           -V[V]  Print version info.  If -VV is given, only the version
                  information is printed.
           -d debuglevel
                  Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapwhoami
                  must be compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option
                  to have any effect.
           -n     Show what would be done, but don't actually perform the
                  whoami operation.  Useful for debugging in conjunction
                  with -v.
           -v     Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to
                  standard output.
           -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.
           -D binddn
                  Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP
                  directory.  For SASL binds, the server is expected to
                  ignore this value.
           -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of
                  specifying the password on the command line.
           -w passwd
                  Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.
           -y passwdfile
                  Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for
                  simple authentication.
           -H ldapuri
                  Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the
                  protocol/host/port fields are allowed; a list of URI,
                  separated by whitespace or commas is expected.
           -e [!]ext[=extparam]
           -E [!]ext[=extparam]
                  Specify general extensions with -e and whoami extensions
                  with -E.  ´!´ indicates criticality.
                  General extensions:
                    [!]assert=<filter>    (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                    !authzid=<authzid>    ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                    [!]bauthzid           (RFC 3829 authzid control)
                    [!]chaining[=<resolve>[/<cont>]]
                    [!]manageDSAit
                    [!]noop
                    ppolicy
                    [!]postread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                    [!]preread[=<attrs>]  (a comma-separated attribute list)
                    [!]relax
                    sessiontracking[=<username>]
                    abandon,cancel,ignore (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel,
                    or ignores response; if critical, doesn't wait for SIGINT.
                    not really controls)
                  WhoAmI extensions:
                    (none)
           -o opt[=optparam]
                  Specify any ldap.conf(5) option or one of the following:
                    nettimeout=<timeout>  (in seconds, or "none" or "max")
                    ldif_wrap=<width>     (in columns, or "no" for no wrapping)
                  -o option that can be passed here, check ldap.conf(5) for
                  details.
           -O security-properties
                  Specify SASL security properties.
           -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is
                  to prompt only as needed.
           -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.
           -N     Do not use reverse DNS to canonicalize SASL host name.
           -U authcid
                  Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
                  the ID depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.
           -R realm
                  Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The
                  form of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism
                  used.
           -X authzid
                  Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.
                  authzid must be one of the following formats:
                  dn:<distinguished name> or u:<username>
           -Y mech
                  Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication.
                  If it's not specified, the program will choose the best
                  mechanism the server knows.
           -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended
                  operation. If you use -ZZ, the command will require the
                  operation to be successful.
