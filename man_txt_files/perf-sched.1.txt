## NAME         top
           perf-sched - Tool to trace/measure scheduler properties
           (latencies)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           perf sched {record|latency|map|replay|script|timehist}
## DESCRIPTION         top
           There are several variants of perf sched:
               'perf sched record <command>' to record the scheduling events
               of an arbitrary workload.
               'perf sched latency' to report the per task scheduling latencies
               and other scheduling properties of the workload.
               'perf sched script' to see a detailed trace of the workload that
                was recorded (aliased to 'perf script' for now).
               'perf sched replay' to simulate the workload that was recorded
               via perf sched record. (this is done by starting up mockup threads
               that mimic the workload based on the events in the trace. These
               threads can then replay the timings (CPU runtime and sleep patterns)
               of the workload as it occurred when it was recorded - and can repeat
               it a number of times, measuring its performance.)
               'perf sched map' to print a textual context-switching outline of
               workload captured via perf sched record.  Columns stand for
               individual CPUs, and the two-letter shortcuts stand for tasks that
               are running on a CPU. A '*' denotes the CPU that had the event, and
               a dot signals an idle CPU.
               'perf sched timehist' provides an analysis of scheduling events.
               Example usage:
                   perf sched record -- sleep 1
                   perf sched timehist
               By default it shows the individual schedule events, including the wait
               time (time between sched-out and next sched-in events for the task), the
               task scheduling delay (time between wakeup and actually running) and run
               time for the task:
                           time    cpu  task name             wait time  sch delay   run time
                                        [tid/pid]                (msec)     (msec)     (msec)
