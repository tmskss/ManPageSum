## NAME         top
           dpkg-scanpackages - create Packages index files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dpkg-scanpackages [option...] binary-path [override-file [path-
           prefix]] > Packages
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dpkg-scanpackages sorts through a tree of Debian binary packages
           and creates a Packages file, used by apt(8), dselect(1), etc, to
           tell the user what packages are available for installation. These
           Packages files are the same as those found on Debian archive
           sites and CD-ROMs. You might use dpkg-scanpackages yourself if
           making a directory of local packages to install on a cluster of
           machines.
           Note: If you want to access the generated Packages file with
           apt(8) you will probably need to compress the file with xz(1)
           (generating a Packages.xz file), bzip2(1) (generating a
           Packages.bz2 file) or gzip(1) (generating a Packages.gz file).
           apt(8) ignores uncompressed Packages files except on local access
           (i.e.  file:// sources).
           binary-path is the name of the tree of the binary packages to
           process (for example, contrib/binary-i386).  It is best to make
           this relative to the root of the Debian archive, because every
           Filename field in the new Packages file will start with this
           string.
           override-file is the name of a file to read which contains
           information about how the package fits into the distribution (the
           file can be compressed since dpkg 1.15.5); see deb-override(5).
           path-prefix is an optional string to be prepended to the Filename
           fields.
           If more than one version of a package is found only the newest
           one is included in the output. If they have the same version and
           only differ in architecture only the first one found is used.
## OPTIONS         top
           -t, --type type
               Scan for *.type packages, instead of *.deb.
           -e, --extra-override file
               Scan file to find supplementary overrides (the file can be
               compressed since dpkg 1.15.5).  See deb-extra-override(5) for
               more information on its format.
           -a, --arch arch
               Use a pattern consisting of *_all.deb and *_arch.deb instead
               of scanning for all debs.
           -h, --hash hash-list
               Only generate file hashes for the comma-specified list
               specified (since dpkg 1.17.14).  The default is to generate
               all currently supported hashes.  Supported values: md5, sha1,
               sha256.
           -m, --multiversion
               Include all found packages in the output.
           -M, --medium id-string
               Add an X-Medium field containing the value id-string (since
               dpkg 1.15.5).  This field is required if you want to generate
               Packages.cd files for use by the media access method of
               dselect.
           -?, --help
               Show the usage message and exit.
           --version
               Show the version and exit.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           DPKG_COLORS
               Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
               accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.
           DPKG_NLS
               If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
               Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
               i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are:
               0 and 1 (default).
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           dpkg-scanpackages outputs the usual self-explanatory errors. It
           also warns about packages that are in the wrong subdirectory, are
           duplicated, have a Filename field in their control file, are
           missing from the override file, or have maintainer substitutions
           which do not take effect.
