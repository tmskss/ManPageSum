## NAME         top
           pmdabind2 - BIND performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This PMDA extracts performance data from BIND (Berkeley Internet
           Name Domain).  It enables collection of most of the statistics
           metrics from the Bind server version 9 or later, which includes:
           • overall memory statistics
           • overall per-query statistics (general queries, EDNS/truncated
             responses, Update/Notify/AXFR/IXFR messages)
           • overall error statistics (Rejected, SERVFAIL, Update/XFR
             failures ...)
           • overall statistics per transport protocol, EDNS and per version
             of IP protocol
           • resolver statistics (successes, errors, round-trip times in
             several ranges)
           • detailed per-socket statistics with respect to the transport
             protcol and IP version including errors
           • detailed per-file-descriptor statistics including errors
           The PMDA performs per-second collection of the whole data set
           (148 metrics on the test environment) with modest requirements
           (2% CPU usage on Intel i7-4700MQ @2.4 GHz, cca 30 MB RAM).
           If more than 1 requests/sec is performed, the memoized values are
           used so that the statistics interface of the Bind server does not
           get overloaded.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Configure BIND to export XML statistics via its REST interface.
           This requires BIND configuration to enable statistics exporting
           locally (at least).
               statistics-channels {
                   inet 127.0.0.1 port 8080 allow { 127.0.0.1; };
               }
               options { zone-statistics yes; }
               # ./Install
           The hostname (localhost), port (8080 above) and other
           configuration information must be specified in both the BIND
           configuration file as well as the $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/bind2.conf
           file.
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2
               # [ edit bind2.conf ]
                 host=localhost.localdomain:8080
           Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
           bind2 performance metrics by doing the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2
               # ./Remove
           pmdabind2 is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/bind2.conf
               mandatory configuration file listing monitored bind2
               instances
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/Install
               installation script for the pmdabind2 agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdabind2 agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/bind2.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdabind2
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
