    FLATPAK MASK(1)               flatpak mask               FLATPAK MASK(1)
## NAME         top
           flatpak-mask - Mask out updates and automatic installation
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak mask [OPTION...] PATTERN...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Flatpak maintains a list of patterns that define which refs are
           masked. A masked ref will never be updated or automatically
           installed (for example a masked extension marked auto-download
           will not be downloaded). You can still manually install such
           refs, but once they are installed the version will be pinned.
           The patterns are just a partial ref, with the * character
           matching anything within that part of the ref. Here are some
           example patterns:
               org.some.App
               org.some.App//unstable
               app/org.domain.*
               org.some.App/arm
           To list the current set of masks, run this command without any
           patterns.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           --remove
               Instead of adding the patterns, remove matching patterns.
           -u, --user
               Mask refs in a per-user installation.
           --system
               Mask refs in the default system-wide installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Mask refs in a system-wide installation specified by NAME
               among those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
## EXAMPLES         top
           $ flatpak mask
           $ flatpak mask org.broken.App
           $ flatpak mask --remove org.broken.App
