## NAME         top
           pmdamongodb - MongoDB database metrics
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdamongodb is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics
           Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts live performance data from a
           running MongoDB database server.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           Firstly, pmdamongodb requires installation of the pymongo support
           packages - a general purpose Python module for querying MongoDB.
           Next, pmdamongodb reads an optional ini-style configuration file:
                  $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mongodb/mongodb.conf
           This file currently allows for two sections, one for configuring
           the MongoDB socket connection, the other for authentication.
           [connection]
           host (localhost)
                  Connect to the MongoDB socket on the given hostname.
           port (27017)
                  Connect to the MongoDB socket on the given port.
           [authentication]
           username (empty)
                  Username to connect to the database.
           password (empty)
                  Password to connect to the database.
## INSTALLATION         top
           To install, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mongodb
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mongodb
               # ./Remove
           pmdamongodb is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mongodb/mongodb.conf
                configuration file for the pmdamongodb agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mongodb/Install
                installation script for the pmdamongodb agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mongodb/Remove
                undo installation script for the pmdamongodb agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mongodb.log
                default log file for messages from the pmdamongodb agent
           Note that the usual/default value for $PCP_PMDAS_DIR is
           /var/lib/pcp/pmdas and the default for $PCP_LOG_DIR is
           /var/log/pcp but these settings are platform dependent.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
