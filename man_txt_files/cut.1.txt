           cut - remove sections from each line of files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cut OPTION... [FILE]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.
           With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.

                  select only these bytes
           -c, --characters=LIST
                  select only these characters
           -d, --delimiter=DELIM
                  use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter
           -f, --fields=LIST
                  select only these fields;  also print any line that
                  contains no delimiter character, unless the -s option is
                  specified
           -n     (ignored)
           --complement
                  complement the set of selected bytes, characters or fields
           -s, --only-delimited
                  do not print lines not containing delimiters
           --output-delimiter=STRING
                  use STRING as the output delimiter the default is to use
                  the input delimiter
           -z, --zero-terminated
                  line delimiter is NUL, not newline
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           Use one, and only one of -b, -c or -f.  Each LIST is made up of
           one range, or many ranges separated by commas.  Selected input is
           written in the same order that it is read, and is written exactly
           once.  Each range is one of:
           N      N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1
           N-     from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line
           N-M    from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field
           -M     from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field
