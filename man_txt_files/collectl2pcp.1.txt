    COLLECTL2PCP(1)          General Commands Manual         COLLECTL2PCP(1)
## NAME         top
           collectl2pcp - import collectl data to a PCP archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           collectl2pcp [-fv?]  file [file ...]  archive
## DESCRIPTION         top
           collectl2pcp reads raw collectl(1) data from each file and
           creates a new PCP archive with basename archive.  Each input file
           may be gzipped (with .gz suffix).  The PCP archive and at least
           one input file are required arguments.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -f, --force
                Overwrite archive (and the index and meta files) if it
                already exists.
           -v, --verbose
                Report progress and errors verbosely.  This also reports a
                count of unsupported metric data in the collectl(1) input
                file(s), which is normally silently skipped.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
           file [file ...]
                These are the collectl(1) input files.  If more than one is
                given, they must contain data for the same host and be given
                in time-stamp chronological order on the command line.  Note
                that when collectl(1) is run as a service, it normally
                creates files with date based names that will sort
                chronologically (e.g. /var/log/collectl/*.gz will be sorted
                correctly).
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
## SEE ALSO         top
           collectl(1), PCPIntro(1), LOGIMPORT(3), pcp.conf(5), pcp.env(5)
           and PMNS(5).
