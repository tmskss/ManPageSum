## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           strip — remove unnecessary information from strippable files
           (DEVELOPMENT)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           strip file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           A strippable file is defined as a relocatable, object, or
           executable file.  On XSI-conformant systems, a strippable file
           can also be an archive of object or relocatable files.
           The strip utility shall remove from strippable files named by the
           file operands any information the implementor deems unnecessary
           for execution of those files. The nature of that information is
           unspecified. The effect of strip on object and executable files
           shall be similar to the use of the -s option to c99 or fort77.
           The effect of strip on an archive of object files shall be
           similar to the use of the -s option to c99 or fort77 for each
           object file in the archive.
## OPTIONS         top
           None.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           file      A pathname referring to a strippable file.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The input files shall be in the form of strippable files
           successfully produced by any compiler defined by this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017 or produced by creating or updating an archive of
           such files using the ar utility.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           strip:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           Not used.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           The strip utility shall produce strippable files of unspecified
           format.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           None.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           Historically, this utility has been used to remove the symbol
           table from a strippable file. It was included since it is known
           that the amount of symbolic information can amount to several
           megabytes; the ability to remove it in a portable manner was
           deemed important, especially for smaller systems.
           The behavior of strip on object and executable files is said to
           be the same as the -s option to a compiler. While the end result
           is essentially the same, it is not required to be identical.
           XSI-conformant systems support use of strip on archive files
           containing object files or relocatable files.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
