    KBD_MODE(1)              General Commands Manual             KBD_MODE(1)
## NAME         top
           kbd_mode - report or set the keyboard mode
## SYNOPSIS         top
           kbd_mode [ -a | -u | -k | -s ] [ -f ] [ -C CONSOLE ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Without argument, kbd_mode prints the current keyboard mode (RAW,
           MEDIUMRAW or XLATE).  With argument, it sets the keyboard mode as
           indicated:
           -s: scancode mode (RAW),
           -k: keycode mode (MEDIUMRAW),
           -a: ASCII mode (XLATE),
           -u: UTF-8 mode (UNICODE).
           Of course the "-a" is only traditional, and the code used can be
           any 8-bit character set.  With "-u" a 16-bit character set is
           expected, and these chars are transmitted to the kernel as 1, 2,
           or 3 bytes (following the UTF-8 coding).  In these latter two
           modes the key mapping defined by loadkeys(1) is used.
           kbd_mode operates on the console specified by the "-C" option; if
           there is none, the console associated with stdin is used.
           Warning: changing the keyboard mode, other than between ASCII and
           Unicode, will probably make your keyboard unusable. Set the "-f"
           option to force such changes.  This command is only meant for use
           (say via remote login) when some program left your keyboard in
           the wrong state.  Note that in some obsolete versions of this
           program the "-u" option was a synonym for "-s" and older versions
           of this program may not recognize the "-f" option.
