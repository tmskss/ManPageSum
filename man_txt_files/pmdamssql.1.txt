## NAME         top
           pmdamssql - Microsoft SQL Server database PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdamssql is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics
           Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts live performance data from a
           running Microsoft SQL Server database server.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           Firstly, pmdamssql requires installation of these support
           packages:
           mssql-server
                The primary Microsoft SQL Server database package.
           msodbcsql18, msodbcsql17 or msodbcsql
                Microsoft SQL Server ODBC bindings.
           pyodbc
                General Python ODBC module with Microsoft SQL Server support
                enabled.
           Next, pmdamssql reads an optional ini-style configuration file:
                  $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql/mssql.conf
           This file currently allows for two sections, one for configuring
           the library that connects to SQL server, the other for
           authenticating with SQL server.
           [connection] section specifies values for the following settings
           (their default values are shown in parenthesis):
           driver ({ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server})
                  ODBC driver string.
           server (tcp:localhost)
                  SQL Server socket connection string.
           timeout (2)
                  Connection timeout setting, in seconds.
           [authentication] section specifies values for the two supported
           modes of authentication with SQL Server.
           The default is to use SQL Server authentication, which requires a
           username and password to be provided.  These are the following
           configuration settings (their default values are shown in
           parenthesis):
           username (pcp)
                  Username to connect to the database.
           password (empty)
                  Password to connect to the database.
           Note that if a SQL Server Assessments API configuration file is
           found at /var/opt/mssql/secrets/assessment, then pmdamssql reads
           the username and password from that file preferentially.  The
           format is simply a two line text file, the first containing the
           username and the second the password.
           The second option is Windows authentication mode, where logins
           are created in SQL Server that are not based on operating system
           user accounts.
           trusted (false)
                  Set to true to use Windows authentication when connecting
                  to the database.
           This is a Kerberos-style connection and credentials must be
           available before the PMDA is started (see kinit(1) for further
           details).
## INSTALLATION         top
           To install, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql
               # ./Remove
           pmdamssql is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
           pmdamssql will automatically attempt to reconnect to the SQL
           Server if its connection is lost - e.g. if the SQL Server service
           is restarted.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql/mssql.conf
                configuration file for the pmdamssql agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql/Install
                installation script for the pmdamssql agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mssql/Remove
                undo installation script for the pmdamssql agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mssql.log
                default log file for messages from the pmdamssql agent
           Note that the usual/default value for $PCP_PMDAS_DIR is
           /var/lib/pcp/pmdas and the default for $PCP_LOG_DIR is
           /var/log/pcp but these settings are platform dependent.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
