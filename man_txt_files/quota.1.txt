## DESCRIPTION         top
           quota displays users' disk usage and limits.  By default only the
           user quotas are printed. By default space usage and limits are
           shown in kbytes (and are named blocks for historical reasons).
           quota reports the quotas of all the filesystems listed in
           /etc/mtab.  For filesystems that are NFS-mounted a call to the
           rpc.rquotad on the server machine is performed to get the
           information.
## OPTIONS         top
           -F, --format=format-name
                  Show quota for specified format (ie. don't perform format
                  autodetection).  Possible format names are: vfsold
                  Original quota format with 16-bit UIDs / GIDs, vfsv0 Quota
                  format with 32-bit UIDs / GIDs, 64-bit space usage, 32-bit
                  inode usage and limits, vfsv1 Quota format with 64-bit
                  quota limits and usage, rpc (quota over NFS), xfs (quota
                  on XFS filesystem)
           -g, --group
                  Print group quotas for the group of which the user is a
                  member.  The optional group argument(s) restricts the
                  display to the specified group(s).
           -u, --user
                  flag is equivalent to the default.
           -P, --project
                  Print project quotas for the specified project.
           -v, --verbose
                  will display quotas on filesystems where no storage is
                  allocated.
           -s, --human-readable[=units]
                  option will make quota(1) try to choose units for showing
                  limits, used space and used inodes. Units can be also
                  specified explicitely by an optional argument in format [
                  kgt ],[ kgt ] where the first character specifies space
                  units and the second character specifies inode units.
           --always-resolve
                  Always try to translate user / group name to uid / gid
                  even if the name is composed of digits only.
           -p, --raw-grace
                  When user is in grace period, report time in seconds since
                  epoch when his grace time runs out (or has run out). Field
                  is '0' when no grace time is in effect.  This is
                  especially useful when parsing output by a script.
           -i, --no-autofs
                  ignore mountpoints mounted by automounter
           -l, --local-only
                  report quotas only on local filesystems (ie. ignore NFS
                  mounted filesystems).
           -A, --all-nfs
                  report quotas for all NFS filesystems even if they report
                  to be on the same device.
           -f, --filesystem-list
                  report quotas only for filesystems specified on command
                  line.
           --filesystem=path
                  report quotas only for filesystem path.  This option can
                  be specified multiple types and quota will be reported for
                  each specified filesystem. Unlike command line option -f
                  remaining command like arguments are still treated as user
                  / group / project names to report.
           -m, --no-mixed-pathnames
                  Currently, pathnames of NFSv4 mountpoints are sent without
                  leading slash in the path.  rpc.rquotad uses this to
                  recognize NFSv4 mounts and properly prepend pseudoroot of
                  NFS filesystem to the path. If you specify this option,
                  quota will always send paths with a leading slash. This
                  can be useful for legacy reasons but be aware that quota
                  over RPC will stop working if you are using new
                  rpc.rquotad.
           -q, --quiet
                  Print a more terse message, containing only information on
                  filesystems where usage is over quota.
           -Q, --quiet-refuse
                  Do not print error message if connection to rpc.rquotad is
                  refused (usually this happens when rpc.rquotad is not
                  running on the server).
           -w, --no-wrap
                  Do not wrap the line if the device name is too long. This
                  can be useful when parsing the output of quota(1) by a
                  script.
           --show-mntpoint
                  Show also mount point as a filesystem identification.
           --hide-device
                  Do not show device name in a filesystem identification.
           Specifying both -g and -u displays both the user quotas and the
           group quotas (for the user).
           Only the super-user may use the -u flag and the optional user
           argument to view the limits of other users. Also viewing of
           project quota usage and limits is limited to super-user only.
           Non-super-users can use the -g flag and optional group argument
           to view only the limits of groups of which they are members.
           The -q flag takes precedence over the -v flag.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           If quota exits with a non-zero status, one or more filesystems
           are over quota.
## FILES         top
           aquota.user  or  aquota.group
                  quota file at the filesystem root (version 2 quota, non-
                  XFS filesystems)
           quota.user  or  quota.group
                  quota file at the filesystem root (version 1 quota, non-
                  XFS filesystems)
           /etc/mtab
                  default filesystems
