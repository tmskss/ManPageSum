## NAME         top
           scriptreplay - play back typescripts, using timing information
## SYNOPSIS         top
           scriptreplay [options] [-t] timingfile [typescript [divisor]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This program replays a typescript, using timing information to
           ensure that output happens in the same rhythm as it originally
           appeared when the script was recorded.
           The replay simply displays the information again; the programs
           that were run when the typescript was being recorded are not run
           again. Since the same information is simply being displayed,
           scriptreplay is only guaranteed to work properly if run on the
           same type of terminal the typescript was recorded on. Otherwise,
           any escape characters in the typescript may be interpreted
           differently by the terminal to which scriptreplay is sending its
           output.
           The timing information is what script(1) outputs to file
           specified by --log-timing.
           By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named
           typescript, but other filenames may be specified, as the second
           parameter or with option --log-out.
           If the third parameter or --divisor is specified, it is used as a
           speed-up multiplier. For example, a speed-up of 2 makes
           scriptreplay go twice as fast, and a speed-down of 0.1 makes it
           go ten times slower than the original session.
## OPTIONS         top
           -I, --log-in file
               File containing script's terminal input.
           -O, --log-out file
               File containing script's terminal output.
           -B, --log-io file
               File containing script's terminal output and input.
           -t, --timing file
               File containing script's timing output. This option overrides
               old-style arguments.
           -T, --log-timing file
               This is an alias for -t, maintained for compatibility with
               script(1) command-line options.
           -s, --typescript file
               File containing script's terminal output. Deprecated alias to
               --log-out. This option overrides old-style arguments.
           -c, --cr-mode mode
               Specifies how to use the CR (0x0D, carriage return) character
               from log files. The default mode is auto, in this case CR is
               replaced with line break for stdin log, because otherwise
               scriptreplay would overwrite the same line. The other modes
               are never and always.
           -d, --divisor number
               Speed up the replay displaying this number of times. The
               argument is a floating-point number. It’s called divisor
               because it divides the timings by this factor. This option
               overrides old-style arguments.
           -m, --maxdelay number
               Set the maximum delay between updates to number of seconds.
               The argument is a floating-point number. This can be used to
               avoid long pauses in the typescript replay.
           --summary
               Display details about the session recorded in the specified
               timing file and exit. The session has to be recorded using
               advanced format (see script(1) option --logging-format for
               more details).
           -x, --stream type
               Forces scriptreplay to print only the specified stream. The
               supported stream types are in, out, signal, or info. This
               option is recommended for multi-stream logs (e.g., --log-io)
               in order to print only specified data.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## EXAMPLES         top
               % script --log-timing file.tm --log-out script.out
               Script started, file is script.out
               % ls
               <etc, etc>
               % exit
               Script done, file is script.out
               % scriptreplay --log-timing file.tm --log-out script.out
