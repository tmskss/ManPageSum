## NAME         top
           cg_merge - (deprecated) merges multiple Cachegrind output files
           into one
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cg_merge [options] [cachegrind-out-files...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           cg_merge sums together multiple Cachegrind output files into a
           single Cachegrind output file. It is deprecated because
           cg_annotate can now do much the same thing, but better.
## OPTIONS         top
           -o outfile
               Write the output to to outfile instead of standard output.
## SEE ALSO         top
           cg_annotate(1), valgrind(1),
           $INSTALL/share/doc/valgrind/html/index.html or
