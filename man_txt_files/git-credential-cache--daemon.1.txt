# git-credential-cache--daemon(1) -- Linux manual page
NAME | SYNOPSIS | DESCRIPTION | GIT | COLOPHON  
    GIT-CREDENTIAL-CACHE--DAEMON(1)Git ManualGIT-CREDENTIAL-CACHE--DAEMON(1)
## NAME         top
           git-credential-cache--daemon - Temporarily store user credentials
           in memory
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git credential-cache--daemon [--debug] <socket-path>
## DESCRIPTION         top
               Note
               You probably don’t want to invoke this command yourself; it
               is started automatically when you use
               git-credential-cache(1).
           This command listens on the Unix domain socket specified by
           <socket-path> for git-credential-cache clients. Clients may store
           and retrieve credentials. Each credential is held for a timeout
           specified by the client; once no credentials are held, the daemon
           exits.
           If the --debug option is specified, the daemon does not close its
           stderr stream, and may output extra diagnostics to it even after
           it has begun listening for clients.
