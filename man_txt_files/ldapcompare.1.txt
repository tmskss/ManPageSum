           ldapcompare - LDAP compare tool
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ldapcompare [-V[V]] [-d debuglevel] [-n] [-v] [-z] [-M[M]] [-x]
           [-D binddn] [-W] [-w passwd] [-y passwdfile] [-H ldapuri]
           [-P {2|3}] [-e [!]ext[=extparam]] [-E [!]ext[=extparam]]

## DESCRIPTION         top
           ldapcompare is a shell-accessible interface to the
           ldap_compare_ext(3) library call.
           ldapcompare opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and
           performs a compare using specified parameters.   The DN should be
           a distinguished name in the directory.  Attr should be a known
           attribute.  If followed by one colon, the assertion value should
           be provided as a string.  If followed by two colons, the base64
           encoding of the value is provided.  The result code of the
           compare is provided as the exit code and, unless ran with -z, the
           program prints TRUE, FALSE, or UNDEFINED on standard output.
## OPTIONS         top
           -V[V]  Print version info.  If -VV is given, only the version
                  information is printed.
           -d debuglevel
                  Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapcompare
                  must be compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option
                  to have any effect.
           -n     Show what would be done, but don't actually perform the
                  compare.  Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.
           -v     Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to
                  standard output.
           -z     Run in quiet mode, no output is written.  You must check
                  the return status.  Useful in shell scripts.
           -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.
           -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.
           -D binddn
                  Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP
                  directory.  For SASL binds, the server is expected to
                  ignore this value.
           -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of
                  specifying the password on the command line.
           -w passwd
                  Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.
           -y passwdfile
                  Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for
                  simple authentication.  Note that complete means that any
                  leading or trailing whitespaces, including newlines, will
                  be considered part of the password and, unlike other
                  software, they will not be stripped.  As a consequence,
                  passwords stored in files by commands like echo(1) will
                  not behave as expected, since echo(1) by default appends a
                  trailing newline to the echoed string.  The recommended
                  portable way to store a cleartext password in a file for
                  use with this option is to use slappasswd(8) with
                  {CLEARTEXT} as hash and the option -n.
           -H ldapuri
                  Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the
                  protocol/host/port fields are allowed; a list of URI,
                  separated by whitespace or commas is expected.
           -P {2|3}
                  Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.
           -e [!]ext[=extparam]
           -E [!]ext[=extparam]
                  Specify general extensions with -e and compare extensions
                  with -E.  ´!´ indicates criticality.
                  General extensions:
                    [!]assert=<filter>    (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                    !authzid=<authzid>    ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                    [!]bauthzid           (RFC 3829 authzid control)
                    [!]chaining[=<resolve>[/<cont>]]
                    [!]manageDSAit
                    [!]noop
                    ppolicy
                    [!]postread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                    [!]preread[=<attrs>]  (a comma-separated attribute list)
                    [!]relax
                    sessiontracking[=<username>]
                    abandon,cancel,ignore (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel,
                    or ignores response; if critical, doesn't wait for SIGINT.
                    not really controls)
                  Compare extensions:
                    !dontUseCopy
           -o opt[=optparam]
                  Specify any ldap.conf(5) option or one of the following:
                    nettimeout=<timeout>  (in seconds, or "none" or "max")
                    ldif_wrap=<width>     (in columns, or "no" for no wrapping)
           -O security-properties
                  Specify SASL security properties.
           -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is
                  to prompt only as needed.
           -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.
           -N     Do not use reverse DNS to canonicalize SASL host name.
           -U authcid
                  Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
                  the ID depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.
           -R realm
                  Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The
                  form of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism
                  used.
           -X authzid
                  Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.
                  authzid must be one of the following formats:
                  dn:<distinguished name> or u:<username>
           -Y mech
                  Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication.
                  If it's not specified, the program will choose the best
                  mechanism the server knows.
           -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended
                  operation. If you use -ZZ, the command will require the
                  operation to be successful.
## EXAMPLES         top
               ldapcompare "uid=babs,dc=example,dc=com"  sn:Jensen
               ldapcompare "uid=babs,dc=example,dc=com"  sn::SmVuc2Vu
           are all equivalent.
## LIMITATIONS         top
           Requiring the value be passed on the command line is limiting and
           introduces some security concerns.  The command should support a
           mechanism to specify the location (file name or URL) to read the
           value from.
