    PSTREE(1)                     User Commands                    PSTREE(1)
## NAME         top
           pstree - display a tree of processes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pstree [-a, --arguments] [-c, --compact-not] [-C, --color attr]
           [-g, --show-pgids]
           [-h, --highlight-all, -H pid, --highlight-pid pid] [-l, --long]
           [-n, --numeric-sort] [-N, --ns-sort ns] [-p, --show-pids]
           [-s, --show-parents] [-S, --ns-changes] [-t, --thread-names]
           [-T, --hide-threads] [-u, --uid-changes] [-Z, --security-context]
           [-A, --ascii, -G, --vt100, -U, --unicode] [pid, user]
           pstree -V, --version
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pstree shows running processes as a tree.  The tree is rooted at
           either pid or init if pid is omitted.  If a user name is
           specified, all process trees rooted at processes owned by that
           user are shown.
           pstree visually merges identical branches by putting them in
           square brackets and prefixing them with the repetition count,
           e.g.
               init-+-getty
                    |-getty
                    |-getty
                    `-getty
           becomes
               init---4*[getty]
           Child threads of a process are found under the parent process and
           are shown with the process name in curly braces, e.g.
               icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]
           If pstree is called as pstree.x11 then it will prompt the user at
           the end of the line to press return and will not return until
           that has happened.  This is useful for when pstree is run in a
           xterminal.
           Certain kernel or mount parameters, such as the hidepid option
           for procfs, will hide information for some processes. In these
           situations pstree will attempt to build the tree without this
           information, showing process names as question marks.
## OPTIONS         top
           -a     Show command line arguments.  If the command line of a
                  process is swapped out, that process is shown in
                  parentheses.  -a implicitly disables compaction for
                  processes but not threads.
           -A     Use ASCII characters to draw the tree.
           -c     Disable compaction of identical subtrees.  By default,
                  subtrees are compacted whenever possible.
           -C     Color the process name by given attribute. Currently
                  pstree only accepts the value age which colors by process
                  age.  Processes newer than 60 seconds are green, newer
                  than an hour yellow and the remaining red.
           -g     Show PGIDs.  Process Group IDs are shown as decimal
                  numbers in parentheses after each process name.  If both
                  PIDs and PGIDs are displayed then PIDs are shown first.
           -G     Use VT100 line drawing characters.
           -h     Highlight the current process and its ancestors.  This is
                  a no-op if the terminal doesn't support highlighting or if
                  neither the current process nor any of its ancestors are
                  in the subtree being shown.
           -H     Like -h, but highlight the specified process instead.
                  Unlike with -h, pstree fails when using -H if highlighting
                  is not available.
           -l     Display long lines.  By default, lines are truncated to
                  either the COLUMNS environment variable or the display
                  width.  If neither of these methods work, the default of
                  132 columns is used.
           -n     Sort processes with the same parent by PID instead of by
                  name.  (Numeric sort.)
           -N     Show individual trees for each namespace of the type
                  specified.  The available types are: ipc, mnt, net, pid,
                  time, user, uts.  Regular users don't have access to other
                  users' processes information, so the output will be
                  limited.
           -p     Show PIDs.  PIDs are shown as decimal numbers in
                  parentheses after each process name.  -p implicitly
                  disables compaction.
           -s     Show parent processes of the specified process.
           -S     Show namespaces transitions.  Like -N, the output is
                  limited when running as a regular user.
           -t     Show full names for threads when available.
           -T     Hide threads and only show processes.
           -u     Show uid transitions.  Whenever the uid of a process
                  differs from the uid of its parent, the new uid is shown
                  in parentheses after the process name.
           -U     Use UTF-8 (Unicode) line drawing characters.  Under Linux
                  1.1-54 and above, UTF-8 mode is entered on the console
                  with echo -e ' 33%8' and left with echo -e ' 33%@'.
           -V     Display version information.
           -Z     Show the current security attributes of the process. For
                  SELinux systems this will be the security context.
## FILES         top
           /proc  location of the proc file system
## BUGS         top
           Some character sets may be incompatible with the VT100
           characters.
