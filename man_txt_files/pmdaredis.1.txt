## NAME         top
           pmdaredis - Redis performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This PMDA extracts performance data from sending the INFO command
           to a Redis (redis.io) server, which includes:
           • General information about the Redis server
           • Client connections
           • Memory consumption
           • Persistence statistics
           • Replication statistics
           • CPU consumption statistics
           • Redis command statistics
           • Redis Cluster statistics
           • Database related statistics
           The hostname (localhost), port (6379 by default) and other
           configuration information must be specified in the
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis/redis.conf file.
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis
               # [ edit redis.conf ]
                 host=localhost.localdomain:6379
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis
               # ./Remove
           Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
           redis performance metrics by doing the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis
               # ./Remove
           pmdaredis is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis/redis.conf
               mandatory configuration file listing monitored redis
               instances
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis/Install
               installation script for the pmdaredis agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdaredis agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/redis.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdaredis
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
