## NAME         top
           setleds - set the keyboard leds
## SYNOPSIS         top
           setleds [-v] [-L] [-D] [-F] [{+|-}num] [{+|-}caps] [{+|-}scroll]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Setleds reports and changes the led flag settings of a VT (namely
           NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock).  Without arguments, setleds
           prints the current settings.  With arguments, it sets or clears
           the indicated flags (and leaves the others unchanged). The
           settings before and after the change are reported if the -v flag
           is given.
           The led flag settings are specific for each VT (and the VT
           corresponding to stdin is used).
           By default (or with option -F), setleds will only change the VT
           flags (and their setting may be reflected by the keyboard leds).
           With option -D, setleds will change both the VT flags and their
           default settings (so that a subsequent reset will not undo the
           change).  This might be useful for people who always want to have
           numlock set.
           With option -L, setleds will not touch the VT flags, but only
           change the leds.  From this moment on, the leds will no longer
           reflect the VT flags (but display whatever is put into them). The
           command setleds -L (without further arguments) will restore the
           situation in which the leds reflect the VT flags.
           One might use setleds in /etc/rc to define the initial and
           default state of NumLock, e.g. by
                INITTY=/dev/tty[1-8]
                for tty in $INITTY; do
                     setleds -D +num < $tty
                done
## OPTIONS         top
           -num +num
                  Clear or set NumLock.  (At present, the NumLock setting
                  influences the interpretation of keypad keys.  Pressing
                  the NumLock key complements the NumLock setting.)
           -caps +caps
                  Clear or set CapsLock.  (At present, the CapsLock setting
                  complements the Shift key when applied to letters.
                  Pressing the CapsLock key complements the CapsLock
                  setting.)
           -scroll +scroll
                  Clear or set ScrollLock.  (At present, pressing the
                  ScrollLock key (or ^S/^Q) stops/starts console output.)
## BUGS         top
           In keyboard application mode the NumLock key does not influence
           the NumLock flag setting.
