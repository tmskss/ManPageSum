## NAME         top
           flatpak-history - Show history
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak history [OPTION...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Shows changes to the flatpak installations on the system. This
           includes installs, updates and removals of applications and
           runtimes.
           By default, both per-user and system-wide installations are
           shown. Use the --user, --installation or --system options to
           change this.
           The information for the history command is taken from the systemd
           journal, and can also be accessed using e.g.  journalctl
           MESSAGE_ID=c7b39b1e006b464599465e105b361485

               YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, or a relative time like "2h", "7days",
               "4days 2hours".
           --until=TIME
               Only show changes that are older than the time specified by
               TIME.

           --columns=FIELD,...
               Specify what information to show about each ref. You can list
               multiple fields, or use this option multiple times.
               Append :s[tart], :m[iddle], :e[nd] or :f[ull] to column names
               to change ellipsization.
