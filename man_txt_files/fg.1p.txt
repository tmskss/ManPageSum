    FG(1P)                  POSIX Programmer's Manual                 FG(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           fg — run jobs in the foreground
## SYNOPSIS         top
           fg [job_id]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           If job control is enabled (see the description of set -m), the fg
           utility shall move a background job from the current environment
           (see Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment) into the
           foreground.
           Using fg to place a job into the foreground shall remove its
           process ID from the list of those ``known in the current shell
           execution environment''; see Section 2.9.3.1, Examples.
## OPTIONS         top
           None.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           job_id    Specify the job to be run as a foreground job. If no
                     job_id operand is given, the job_id for the job that
                     was most recently suspended, placed in the background,
                     or run as a background job shall be used. The format of
                     job_id is described in the Base Definitions volume of
                     POSIX.1‐2017, Section 3.204, Job Control Job ID.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           fg:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The fg utility shall write the command line of the job to
           standard output in the following format:
               "%s\n", <command>
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           If job control is disabled, the fg utility shall exit with an
           error and no job shall be placed in the foreground.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           The fg utility does not work as expected when it is operating in
           its own utility execution environment because that environment
           has no applicable jobs to manipulate. See the APPLICATION USAGE
           section for bg(1p).  For this reason, fg is generally implemented
           as a shell regular built-in.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           The extensions to the shell specified in this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017 have mostly been based on features provided by the
           KornShell. The job control features provided by bg, fg, and jobs
           are also based on the KornShell. The standard developers examined
           the characteristics of the C shell versions of these utilities
           and found that differences exist. Despite widespread use of the C
           shell, the KornShell versions were selected for this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017 to maintain a degree of uniformity with the rest of
           the KornShell features selected (such as the very popular command
           line editing features).
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
