## NAME         top
           pmdajbd2 - journal block device (JBD) performance metrics domain
           agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2/pmdajbd2 [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-j path]
           [-U username]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdajbd2 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts performance metrics from the Journal Block Device
           subsystem (version 2) in the Linux kernel.  These metrics are
           exported by the kernel in procfs files, one file per block
           device.  The JBD2 subsystem is used by several filesystems
           including ext3, ext4 and ocfs2.
           The jbd2 PMDA exports metrics that measure detailed journal
           transaction information, such as time spent waiting and locked,
           request rates, blocks used and so on.
           A brief description of the pmdajbd2 command line options follows
           (these are only relevant when running the PMDA as a daemon, and
           not as a shared library):
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, when running as a
                daemon a log file named jbd2.log is written in the current
                directory of when pmdajbd2 is started, i.e.
                $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file cannot be created or is
                not writable, output is written to the standard error
                instead.  When running in shared library mode, and
                diagnostic information will be written into the pmcd log
                file, namely $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log.
           -j   Allows an alternate path to the jbd2 statistics files to be
                specified.  The default path is /proc/fs/jbd2.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
## INSTALLATION         top
           This PMDA is installed by default and in the shared library mode
           (rather than as a separate daemon to pmcd(1)).  Thus, the names,
           help text and values for the jbd2 performance metrics should
           always be available.
           If you do not use these metrics you can remove this PMDA, do the
           following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2
                # ./Remove
           If you want to enable the installation again, do the following as
           root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2
                # ./Install
           pmdajbd2 is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
