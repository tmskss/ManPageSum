    FLATPAK SPAWN(1)              flatpak spawn             FLATPAK SPAWN(1)
## NAME         top
           flatpak-spawn - Run commands in a sandbox
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak-spawn [OPTION...] COMMAND [ARGUMENT...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Unlike other flatpak commands, flatpak-spawn is available to
           applications inside the sandbox. It runs COMMAND outside the
           sandbox: either in another sandbox, or on the host.
           When called without --host, flatpak-spawn uses the Flatpak portal
           to create a copy of the sandbox it was called from, optionally
           using tighter permissions and optionally the latest version of
           the app and runtime (see --latest-version).
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information
           --forward-fd=FD
               Forward a file descriptor
           --clear-env
               Run with a clean environment
           --watch-bus
               Make the spawned command exit if the caller disappears from
               the session bus
           --env=VAR=VALUE
               Set an environment variable
           --latest-version
               Use the latest version of the refs that are used to set up
               the sandbox
           --no-network
               Run without network access
           --sandbox
               Run fully sandboxed. See the documentation for the --sandbox
               option in flatpak-run(1)
               See the --sandbox-expose and --sandbox-expose-ro options for
               selective file access.
           --sandbox-expose=NAME
               Expose read-write access to a file in the sandbox.
               Note that absolute paths or subdirectories are not allowed.
               The files must be in the sandbox subdirectory of the instance
               directory (i.e.  ~/.var/app/$APP_ID/sandbox).
               This option is useful in combination with --sandbox
               (otherwise the instance directory is accessible anyway).
           --sandbox-expose-ro=NAME
               Expose readonly access to a file in the sandbox.
               Note that absolute paths or subdirectories are not allowed.
               The files must be in the sandbox subdirectory of the instance
               directory (i.e.  ~/.var/app/$APP_ID/sandbox).
               This option is useful in combination with --sandbox
               (otherwise the instance directory is accessible anyway).
           --host
               Run the command unsandboxed on the host. This requires access
               to the org.freedesktop.Flatpak D-Bus interface.
           --directory=DIR
               The working directory in which to run the command.
               Note that the given directory must exist in the sandbox or,
               when used in conjunction with --host, on the host.
## EXAMPLES         top
           $ flatpak-spawn ls /var/run
