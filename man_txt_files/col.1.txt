## NAME         top
           col - filter reverse line feeds from input
## SYNOPSIS         top
           col options
## DESCRIPTION         top
           col filters out reverse (and half-reverse) line feeds so the
           output is in the correct order, with only forward and
           half-forward line feeds. It also replaces any whitespace
           characters with tabs where possible. This can be useful in
           processing the output of nroff(1) and tbl(1).
           col reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
## OPTIONS         top
           -b, --no-backspaces
               Do not output any backspaces, printing only the last
               character written to each column position.
           -f, --fine
               Permit half-forward line feeds. Normally characters destined
               for a half-line boundary are printed on the following line.
           -h, --tabs
               Output tabs instead of multiple spaces.
           -l, --lines number
               Buffer at least number lines in memory. By default, 128 lines
               are buffered.
           -p, --pass
               Force unknown control sequences to be passed through
               unchanged. Normally col will filter out any control sequences
               other than those recognized and interpreted by itself, which
               are listed below.
           -x, --spaces
               Output multiple spaces instead of tabs.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## CONFORMING TO         top
           The col utility conforms to the Single UNIX Specification,
           Version 2. The -l option is an extension to the standard.
## NOTES         top
           The control sequences for carriage motion that col understands
           and their decimal values are listed in the following table:
           ESC-7
               reverse line feed (escape then 7)
           ESC-8
               half reverse line feed (escape then 8)
           ESC-9
               half forward line feed (escape then 9)
           backspace
               moves back one column (8); ignored in the first column
           newline
               forward line feed (10); also does carriage return
           carriage return
               (13)
           shift in
               shift to normal character set (15)
           shift out
               shift to alternate character set (14)
           space
               moves forward one column (32)
           tab
               moves forward to next tab stop (9)
           vertical tab
               reverse line feed (11)
           All unrecognized control characters and escape sequences are
           discarded.
           col keeps track of the character set as characters are read and
           makes sure the character set is correct when they are output.
           If the input attempts to back up to the last flushed line, col
           will display a warning message.
## HISTORY         top
           A col command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
## SEE ALSO         top

## REPORTING BUGS         top

## AVAILABILITY         top
           The col command is part of the util-linux package which can be
           downloaded from Linux Kernel Archive
           <https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/>. This page
           is part of the util-linux (a random collection of Linux
           utilities) project. Information about the project can be found at
