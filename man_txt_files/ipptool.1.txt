## DESCRIPTION         top
           ipptool sends IPP requests to the specified printer-uri and tests
           and/or displays the results.  Each named testfile defines one or
           more requests, including the expected response status,
           attributes, and values.  Output is either a plain text, formatted
           text, CSV, or XML report on the standard output, with a non-zero
           exit status indicating that one or more tests have failed.  The
           testfile format is described in ipptoolfile(5).
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are recognized by ipptool:
           --help
                Shows program help.
           --ippserver filename
                Specifies that the test results should be written to the
                named ippserver attributes file.
           --stop-after-include-error
                Tells ipptool to stop if an error occurs in an included
                file. Normally ipptool will continue with subsequent tests
                after the INCLUDE directive.
           --version
                Shows the version of ipptool being used.
           -4   Specifies that ipptool must connect to the printer or server
                using IPv4.
           -6   Specifies that ipptool must connect to the printer or server
                using IPv6.
           -C   Specifies that requests should be sent using the HTTP/1.1
                "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header, which is required for
                conformance by all versions of IPP.  The default is to use
                "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" for requests with attached
                files and "Content-Length:" for requests without attached
                files.
           -E   Forces TLS encryption when connecting to the server using
                the HTTP "Upgrade" header.
           -I   Specifies that ipptool will continue past errors.
           -L   Specifies that requests should be sent using the HTTP/1.0
                "Content-Length:" header, which is required for conformance
                by all versions of IPP.  The default is to use
                "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" for requests with attached
                files and "Content-Length:" for requests without attached
                files.
           -P filename.plist
                Specifies that the test results should be written to the
                named XML (Apple plist) file in addition to the regular test
                report (-t).  This option is incompatible with the -i
                (interval) and -n (repeat-count) options.
           -R   Retries tests when the "server-error-busy" status code is
                returned.
           -S   Forces (dedicated) TLS encryption when connecting to the
                server.
           -T seconds
                Specifies a timeout for IPP requests in seconds.
           -V version
                Specifies the default IPP version to use: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0,
                2.1, or 2.2. If not specified, version 1.1 is used.
           -X   Specifies that XML (Apple plist) output is desired instead
                of the plain text report.  This option is incompatible with
                the -i (interval) and -n (repeat-count) options.
           -c   Specifies that CSV (comma-separated values) output is
                desired instead of the plain text output.
           -d name=value
                Defines the named variable.
           -f filename
                Defines the default request filename for tests.
           -h   Validate HTTP response headers.
           -i seconds
                Specifies that the (last) testfile should be repeated at the
                specified interval.  This option is incompatible with the -X
                (XML plist output) option.
           -l   Specifies that plain text output is desired.
           -n repeat-count
                Specifies that the (last) testfile should be repeated the
                specified number of times.  This option is incompatible with
                the -X (XML plist output) option.
           -q   Be quiet and produce no output.
           -t   Specifies that CUPS test report output is desired instead of
                the plain text output.
           -v   Specifies that all request and response attributes should be
                output in CUPS test mode (-t).  This is the default for XML
                output.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The ipptool program returns 0 if all tests were successful and 1
           otherwise.
