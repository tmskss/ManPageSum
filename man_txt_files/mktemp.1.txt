## NAME         top
           mktemp - create a temporary file or directory
## SYNOPSIS         top
           mktemp [OPTION]... [TEMPLATE]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Create a temporary file or directory, safely, and print its name.
           TEMPLATE must contain at least 3 consecutive 'X's in last
           component.  If TEMPLATE is not specified, use tmp.XXXXXXXXXX, and
           --tmpdir is implied.  Files are created u+rw, and directories
           u+rwx, minus umask restrictions.
           -d, --directory
                  create a directory, not a file
           -u, --dry-run
                  do not create anything; merely print a name (unsafe)
           -q, --quiet
                  suppress diagnostics about file/dir-creation failure
           --suffix=SUFF
                  append SUFF to TEMPLATE; SUFF must not contain a slash.
                  This option is implied if TEMPLATE does not end in X
           -p DIR, --tmpdir[=DIR]
                  interpret TEMPLATE relative to DIR; if DIR is not
                  specified, use $TMPDIR if set, else /tmp.  With this
                  option, TEMPLATE must not be an absolute name; unlike with
                  -t, TEMPLATE may contain slashes, but mktemp creates only
                  the final component
           -t     interpret TEMPLATE as a single file name component,
                  relative to a directory: $TMPDIR, if set; else the
                  directory specified via -p; else /tmp [deprecated]
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
