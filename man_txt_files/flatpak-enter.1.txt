## NAME         top
           flatpak-enter - Enter an application or runtime's sandbox
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak enter [OPTION...] INSTANCE COMMAND [ARG...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Enter a running sandbox.
           INSTANCE must be either the pid of a process running in a flatpak
           sandbox, or the ID of a running application, or the instance ID
           of a running sandbox. You can use flatpak ps to find the instance
           IDs of running flatpaks.
           COMMAND is the command to run in the sandbox. Extra arguments are
           passed on to the command.
           This creates a new process within the running sandbox, with the
           same environment. This is useful when you want to debug a problem
           with a running application.
           This command works as a regular user if the system support
           unprivileged user namespace. If that is not available you need to
           run run it like: sudo -E flatpak enter.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
