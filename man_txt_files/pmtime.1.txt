## NAME         top
           pmtime - time control server for Performance Co-Pilot
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmtime [-V?]  [-p port]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmtime is a graphical user interface for performance monitoring
           applications using the PCP infrastructure and requiring
           interactive time control.
           pmtime is not normally invoked directly by users.  Rather, it is
           more typical for it to be started by client applications (e.g.
           pmchart(1), pmstat(1) or pmval(1)).
           There are two modes of interacting with a pmtime process - live
           host mode, and historical archive mode.  In archive mode the
           window presents time controls suitable for manipulating the
           archive position, allowing full VCR control to move forwards and
           backwards in time at configurable rates and intervals.  In live
           mode the pmtime window contains the simpler time controls
           suitable for live monitoring.
           Note that the pmtime window is only made visible when explicitly
           requested.  Multiple client applications can be connected to a
           single pmtime server - when the final client application exits,
           pmtime will also exit.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -p port, --guiport=port
                port is the port number which pmtime will use for
                communication with its clients (monitoring applications).
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           When a port number is not explicitly requested on the command
           line via the -p option, the environment variable PMTIME_PORT can
           be set to specify the port number from which available-port
           probing will commence when pmtime is searching for a port number
           to use.
           The default starting port number is 43334.
