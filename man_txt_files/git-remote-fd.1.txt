    GIT-REMOTE-FD(1)               Git Manual               GIT-REMOTE-FD(1)
## NAME         top
           git-remote-fd - Reflect smart transport stream back to caller
## SYNOPSIS         top
           "fd::<infd>[,<outfd>][/<anything>]" (as URL)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This helper uses specified file descriptors to connect to a
           remote Git server. This is not meant for end users but for
           programs and scripts calling git fetch, push or archive.
           If only <infd> is given, it is assumed to be a bidirectional
           socket connected to remote Git server (git-upload-pack,
           git-receive-pack or git-upload-archive). If both <infd> and
           <outfd> are given, they are assumed to be pipes connected to a
           remote Git server (<infd> being the inbound pipe and <outfd>
           being the outbound pipe.
           It is assumed that any handshaking procedures have already been
           completed (such as sending service request for git://) before
           this helper is started.
           <anything> can be any string. It is ignored. It is meant for
           providing information to user in the URL in case that URL is
           displayed in some context.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           GIT_TRANSLOOP_DEBUG
               If set, prints debugging information about various
               reads/writes.
## EXAMPLES         top
           git fetch fd::17 master
               Fetch master, using file descriptor #17 to communicate with
               git-upload-pack.
           git fetch fd::17/foo master
               Same as above.
           git push fd::7,8 master (as URL)
               Push master, using file descriptor #7 to read data from
               git-receive-pack and file descriptor #8 to write data to same
               service.
           git push fd::7,8/bar master
               Same as above.
