    WALL(1)                       User Commands                      WALL(1)
## NAME         top
           wall - write a message to all users
## SYNOPSIS         top
           wall [-n] [-t timeout] [-g group] [message | file]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           wall displays a message, or the contents of a file, or otherwise
           its standard input, on the terminals of all currently logged in
           users. The command will wrap lines that are longer than 79
           characters. Short lines are whitespace padded to have 79
           characters. The command will always put a carriage return and new
           line at the end of each line.
           Only the superuser can write on the terminals of users who have
           chosen to deny messages or are using a program which
           automatically denies messages.
           Reading from a file is refused when the invoker is not superuser
           and the program is set-user-ID or set-group-ID.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --nobanner
               Suppress the banner.
           -t, --timeout timeout
               Abandon the write attempt to the terminals after timeout
               seconds. This timeout must be a positive integer. The default
               value is 300 seconds, which is a legacy from the time when
               people ran terminals over modem lines.
           -g, --group group
               Limit printing message to members of group defined as a group
               argument. The argument can be group name or GID.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## NOTES         top
           Some sessions, such as wdm(1x), that have in the beginning of
           utmp(5) ut_type data a ':' character will not get the message
           from wall. This is done to avoid write errors.
## HISTORY         top
           A wall command appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
## SEE ALSO         top
