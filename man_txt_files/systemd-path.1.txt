## NAME         top
           systemd-path - List and query system and user paths
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-path [OPTIONS...] [NAME...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           systemd-path may be used to query system and user paths. The tool
           makes many of the paths described in file-hierarchy(7) available
           for querying.
           When invoked without arguments, a list of known paths and their
           current values is shown. When at least one argument is passed,
           the path with this name is queried and its value shown. The
           variables whose name begins with "search-" do not refer to
           individual paths, but instead to a list of colon-separated search
           paths, in their order of precedence.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           --suffix=
               Printed paths are suffixed by the specified string.
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
