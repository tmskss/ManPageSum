## NAME         top
           pmdanutcracker - NutCracker performance metrics domain agent
           (PMDA)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This PMDA extracts performance data from NutCracker (or
           TwemProxy), a fast and lightweight proxy for memcached and Redis
           protocol.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Configure to export statistics via its stats interface (see
           --stats-port option to the nutcracker server).  The corresponding
           configuration must be reflected in the
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nutcracker/nutcracker.conf file.
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nutcracker
               # [ edit nutcracker.conf ]
           Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
           nutcracker performance metrics by doing the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nutcracker
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nutcracker
               # ./Remove
           pmdanutcracker is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be
           executed directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1)
           when the agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nutcracker/nutcracker.conf
               mandatory configuration file listing monitored memcache or
               Redis instances
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nutcracker/Install
               installation script for the pmdanutcracker agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nutcracker/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdanutcracker agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/nutcracker.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdanutcracker
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
