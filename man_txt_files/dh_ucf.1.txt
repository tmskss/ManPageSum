    DH_UCF(1)                       Debhelper                      DH_UCF(1)
## NAME         top
           dh_ucf - register configuration files with ucf
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_ucf [debhelper options] [-A] [-n] [file ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_ucf is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating
           the postinst and postrm commands that register files with ucf(1)
           and ucfr(1).
## FILES         top
           debian/package.ucf
               List pairs of source and destination files to register with
               ucf. Each pair should be put on its own line, with the source
               and destination separated by whitespace. Both source and
               destination must be absolute paths. The source should be a
               file that is provided by your package, typically in
               /usr/share/, while the destination is typically a file in
               /etc/.
               A dependency on ucf will be generated in ${misc:Depends}.
               Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
               documented in debhelper(7).
## OPTIONS         top
           -A, --all
               Install all files specified by command line parameters in ALL
               packages acted on.
           -n, --no-scripts
               Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts. Turns this command
               into a no-op.
           file ...
               Install these info files into the first package acted on. (Or
               in all packages if -A is specified).
## NOTES         top
           Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
           called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may
           cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
           maintainer scripts.
