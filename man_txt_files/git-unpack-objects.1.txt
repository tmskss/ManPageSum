## NAME         top
           git-unpack-objects - Unpack objects from a packed archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git unpack-objects [-n] [-q] [-r] [--strict]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Read a packed archive (.pack) from the standard input, expanding
           the objects contained within and writing them into the repository
           in "loose" (one object per file) format.
           Objects that already exist in the repository will not be unpacked
           from the packfile. Therefore, nothing will be unpacked if you use
           this command on a packfile that exists within the target
           repository.
           See git-repack(1) for options to generate new packs and replace
           existing ones.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n
               Dry run. Check the pack file without actually unpacking the
               objects.
           -q
               The command usually shows percentage progress. This flag
               suppresses it.
           -r
               When unpacking a corrupt packfile, the command dies at the
               first corruption. This flag tells it to keep going and make
               the best effort to recover as many objects as possible.
           --strict
               Don’t write objects with broken content or links.
           --max-input-size=<size>
               Die, if the pack is larger than <size>.
