## NAME         top
           stg-series - Display the patch series
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg series [OPTIONS] [-A] [-U] [-H]
           stg series [OPTIONS] --all
           stg series [OPTIONS] --short
           stg series [OPTIONS] [patch]...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Show all the patches in the series, or just those in the given
           range, ordered from bottom to top.
           The topmost applied patch is prefixed with >. All other applied
           patches are prefixed with +. Unapplied patches are prefixed with
           - and hidden patches with !.
           The --reverse option may be used to reverse the order in which
           patches are displayed. The reversed order is more stack-like,
           with the base of the stack appearing at the bottom of of the
           display.
           Empty patches are prefixed with a * when the --empty option is
           used.
## OPTIONS         top
           -b <branch>, --branch=<branch>
               Use <branch> instead of current branch
           -a, --all
               Select all patches, including hidden patches
           -s[=<n>], --short[=<n>]
               Select <n> patches around the topmost patch only
           -A, --applied
               Select the applied patches only
           -U, --unapplied
               Select the unapplied patches only
           -H, --hidden
               Select the hidden patches only
           -m <branch>, --missing=<branch>
               Select patches in <branch> not present in current branch
           --author
               Display author name for each patch
           -c, --count
               Display the number of selected patches and exit
           -i[=<length>], --commit-id[=<length>]
               Display the commit id for each patch.
               The optional length indicates how many prefix characters of
               the commit id to display. The default is "full", which
               displays the full commit id, but may alternatively be
               specified as a positive integer greater than or equal to 4.
           -d, --description
               Display short description for each patch
           -e, --empty
               Before the +, >, -, and !  prefixes, print a column that
               contains either 0 (for empty patches) or a space (for
               non-empty patches).
           -P, --no-prefix
               Do not display the patch status prefix
           -I, --indices
               Display absolute patch indicies
           -O, --offsets
               Display relative offsets from topmost patch or from the stack
               base if no patches are applied.
           -r, --reverse
               Display patches in reverse order.
               This causes the stack to be displayed "right-side up". By
               default, patches are printed in order from bottom to top;
               i.e. the first patch in the stack is printed first and the
               last patch is printed last. Thus with the default ordering,
               the stack is displayed upside down. Reversing the order flips
               the stack such that the bottom of the stack is spatially at
               the top of the display, which may be more intuitive.
           --showbranch
               Display the branch name with the listed patches
