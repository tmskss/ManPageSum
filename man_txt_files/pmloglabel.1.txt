## NAME         top
           pmloglabel - check and repair a performance metrics archive label
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmloglabel [-lLsv?]  [-h hostname] [-p pid] [-V version] [-Z
           timezone] archive
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmloglabel verifies, reports on, and can modify all details of
           the labels in each of the files of a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
           archive log.  The archive log has the base name archive and must
           have been previously created using pmlogger(1).
           Each of the files in a PCP archive (metadata, temporal index, and
           one or more data volumes) must contain a valid label at the
           start, else the PCP tools will refuse to open the archive at all.
           Thus, the primary function of pmloglabel is to be able to repair
           any inconsistent or corrupt label fields, such that the entire
           archive is not lost.  It will not check the remainder of the
           archive, but it will give you a fighting chance to recover
           otherwise lost data.  Together, pmloglabel and pmlogextract are
           able to produce a valid PCP archive from many forms of
           corruption.
           Note that if the temporal index is found to be corrupt, the
           "*.index" file can be safely moved aside and the archive will
           still be accessible, however retrievals may take longer without
           the index.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -h hostname, --host=hostname
                Modify the logged hostname in the archive label, for all
                files in the archive.
           -l, --label
                Dump out the archive label, showing the log format version,
                the time and date for the start and (current) end of the
                archive, and the host from which the performance metrics
                values were collected.
           -L   Like -l, just a little more verbose, showing also the
                timezone and creator process identifier from the archive
                label.
           -p pid, --pid=pid
                Set the process identifier stored in the archive label to
                pid, for all files in the archive.
           -s   Rewrite the sentinel values which precede and follow the
                archive label, for all files in the archive.
           -v, --verbose
                Verbose mode.  Additional progress information is produced
                at each step.
           -V version, --version=version
                Stamp the version number into the magic number field at the
                start of the archive label, for all files in the archive.
           -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
                Changes the timezone in the archive labels to timezone in
                the format of the environment variable TZ as described in
                environ(7).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## EXAMPLES         top
           The following demonstrates the use of pmloglabel in finding and
           then correcting a corrupt field (PID) in the label of the
           temporal index of an archive named "20080125".
                     $ pmdumplog -l 20080125
                     pmdumplog: Cannot open archive "20080125": Illegal label record at start of a PCP archive log file
                     $ pmloglabel 20080125
                     Mismatched PID (5264/5011) between temporal index and data volume 0
                     $ pmloglabel -p 5264 20080125
                     $ pmdumplog -l 20080125
                     Log Label (Log Format Version 2)
                     Performance metrics from host fw1
                       commencing Fri Jan 25 00:10:09.341 2008
                       ending     Sat Jan 26 00:09:54.344 2008
## EXIT STATUS         top
           pmloglabel exits with status 0 if the archive labels are clean.
           If invoked incorrectly, the exit status will be 1.  If corruption
           is detected and still exists at the end, the exit status will be
           2.  If requested to write out the archive labels, and some aspect
           of that write out fails, then the exit status will be 3.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/<hostname>
                Default directory for PCP archives containing performance
                metric values collected from the host <hostname>.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
