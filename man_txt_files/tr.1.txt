## NAME         top
           tr - translate or delete characters
## SYNOPSIS         top
           tr [OPTION]... STRING1 [STRING2]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input,
           writing to standard output.  STRING1 and STRING2 specify arrays
           of characters ARRAY1 and ARRAY2 that control the action.
           -c, -C, --complement
                  use the complement of ARRAY1
           -d, --delete
                  delete characters in ARRAY1, do not translate
           -s, --squeeze-repeats
                  replace each sequence of a repeated character that is
                  listed in the last specified ARRAY, with a single
                  occurrence of that character
           -t, --truncate-set1
                  first truncate ARRAY1 to length of ARRAY2
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           ARRAYs are specified as strings of characters.  Most represent
           themselves.  Interpreted sequences are:
           \NNN   character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)
           \\     backslash
           \a     audible BEL
           \b     backspace
           \f     form feed
           \n     new line
           \r     return
           \t     horizontal tab
           \v     vertical tab
           CHAR1-CHAR2
                  all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order
           [CHAR*]
                  in ARRAY2, copies of CHAR until length of ARRAY1
           [CHAR*REPEAT]
                  REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting with 0
           [:alnum:]
                  all letters and digits
           [:alpha:]
                  all letters
           [:blank:]
                  all horizontal whitespace
           [:cntrl:]
                  all control characters
           [:digit:]
                  all digits
           [:graph:]
                  all printable characters, not including space
           [:lower:]
                  all lower case letters
           [:print:]
                  all printable characters, including space
           [:punct:]
                  all punctuation characters
           [:space:]
                  all horizontal or vertical whitespace
           [:upper:]
                  all upper case letters
           [:xdigit:]
                  all hexadecimal digits
           [=CHAR=]
                  all characters which are equivalent to CHAR
           Translation occurs if -d is not given and both STRING1 and
           STRING2 appear.  -t is only significant when translating.  ARRAY2
           is extended to length of ARRAY1 by repeating its last character
           as necessary.  Excess characters of ARRAY2 are ignored.
           Character classes expand in unspecified order; while translating,
           [:lower:] and [:upper:] may be used in pairs to specify case
           conversion.  Squeezing occurs after translation or deletion.
## BUGS         top
           Full support is available only for safe single-byte locales, in
           which every possible input byte represents a single character.
           The C locale is safe in GNU systems, so you can avoid this issue
           in the shell by running LC_ALL=C tr instead of plain tr.
