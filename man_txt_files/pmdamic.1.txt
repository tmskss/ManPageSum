## NAME         top
           pmdamic - MIC card PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdamic is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values about Intel MIC cards using the
           libmicmgmt(7) python bindings.
           This provides information on core, memory and power utilization
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install the MIC PMDA by using the Install script as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mic
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mic
                # ./Remove
           pmdamic is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mic/Install
               installation script for the pmdamic agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mic/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdamic agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mic.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdamic
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
