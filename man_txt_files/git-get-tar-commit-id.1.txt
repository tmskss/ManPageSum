## NAME         top
           git-get-tar-commit-id - Extract commit ID from an archive created
           using git-archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git get-tar-commit-id
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Read a tar archive created by git archive from the standard input
           and extract the commit ID stored in it. It reads only the first
           1024 bytes of input, thus its runtime is not influenced by the
           size of the tar archive very much.
           If no commit ID is found, git get-tar-commit-id quietly exists
           with a return code of 1. This can happen if the archive had not
           been created using git archive or if the first parameter of git
           archive had been a tree ID instead of a commit ID or tag.

           This page is part of the git (Git distributed version control
           system) project.  Information about the project can be found at
           ⟨http://git-scm.com/⟩.  If you have a bug report for this manual
           page, see ⟨http://git-scm.com/community⟩.  This page was obtained
           from the project's upstream Git repository
           ⟨https://github.com/git/git.git⟩ on 2023-06-23.  (At that time,
           the date of the most recent commit that was found in the
           repository was 2023-06-22.)  If you discover any rendering
           problems in this HTML version of the page, or you believe there
           is a better or more up-to-date source for the page, or you have
