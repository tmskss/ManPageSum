## NAME         top
           systemd-id128 - Generate and print sd-128 identifiers
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-id128 [OPTIONS...] new
           systemd-id128 [OPTIONS...] machine-id
           systemd-id128 [OPTIONS...] boot-id
           systemd-id128 [OPTIONS...] invocation-id
## DESCRIPTION         top
           id128 may be used to conveniently print sd-id128(3) UUIDs. What
           identifier is printed depends on the specific verb.
           With new, a new random identifier will be generated.
           With machine-id, the identifier of the current machine will be
           printed. See machine-id(5).
           With boot-id, the identifier of the current boot will be printed.
           Both machine-id and boot-id may be combined with the
           --app-specific=app-id switch to generate application-specific
           IDs. See sd_id128_get_machine(3) for the discussion when this is
           useful.
           With invocation-id, the identifier of the current service
           invocation will be printed. This is available in systemd
           services. See systemd.exec(5).
           With show, well-known IDs are printed (for now, only GPT
           partition type UUIDs), along with brief identifier strings. When
           no arguments are specified, all known IDs are shown. When
           arguments are specified, they must be the identifiers or ID
           values of one or more known IDs, which are then printed. Combine
           with --uuid to list the IDs in UUID style, i.e. the way GPT
           partition type UUIDs are usually shown.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -p, --pretty
               Generate output as programming language snippets.
           -a app-id, --app-specific=app-id
               With this option, an identifier that is the result of hashing
               the application identifier app-id and the machine identifier
               will be printed. The app-id argument must be a valid sd-id128
               string identifying the application.
           -u, --uuid
               Generate output as an UUID formatted in the "canonical
               representation", with five groups of digits separated by
               hyphens. See the wikipedia[1] for more discussion.
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
