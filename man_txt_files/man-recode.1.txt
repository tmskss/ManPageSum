## NAME         top
           man-recode - convert manual pages to another encoding
## SYNOPSIS         top
           man-recode -t to-code {--suffix=suffix|--in-place} [-dqhV]
           [filename]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           man-recode converts multiple manual pages from one encoding to
           another, guessing the appropriate input encoding for each one.
           It is useful when permanently recoding pages written in legacy
           character sets, or in build systems that need to recode a set of
           pages to a single common encoding (usually UTF-8) for
           installation.  When converting many manual pages, this program is
           much faster than running man --recode or manconv on each page.
           If an encoding declaration is found on the first line of a manual
           page, then that declaration is used as the input encoding for
           that page.  Failing that, the input encoding is guessed based on
           the file name.
           Encoding declarations have the following form:
                  '\" -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
           or (if manual page preprocessors are also to be declared):
                  '\" t -*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-
## OPTIONS         top
           -t encoding, --to-code=encoding
                  Convert manual pages to encoding.
           --suffix=suffix
                  Form each output file name by appending suffix to the
                  input file name, after removing any compression extension.
           --in-place
                  Overwrite each input file with the output, after removing
                  any compression extension.
           -q, --quiet
                  Do not issue error messages when the page cannot be
                  converted.
           -d, --debug
                  Print debugging information.
           -h, --help
                  Print a help message and exit.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information.
