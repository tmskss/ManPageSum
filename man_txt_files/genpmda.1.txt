## NAME         top
           genpmda - Performance Co-Pilot PMDA Generator
## SYNOPSIS         top
           genpmda [-dv] [-D domain] [-n pmns] [-o dir] [-s stdpmid] [-t
           topdir] -c config -i IAM
## DESCRIPTION         top
           genpmda is a rapid application development tool for creating new
           Performance Metrics Domain Agents, see PMDA(3).  It provides a
           very easy and efficient way to extend the Performance Co-pilot
           (PCP) with new performance metrics without needing to understand
           the low level details of how PMDAs are constructed.
           genpmda reads a config file containing an augmented Performance
           Metrics Name Space, see PMNS(5), and automatically generates
           virtually all of the source code to implement a fully functional
           PMDA, including the Makefile, name space, support scripts for
           configuring the new PMDA, and the metrics help text.  Fairly
           simple PMDAs can be automatically generated from the config file
           without writing any additional code.  More complicated PMDAs,
           e.g. containing multiple instance domains, require only the
           refresh methods for the instance domains to be written manually.
           An example of the config file format accepted by genpmda is given
           below.
## OPTIONS         top
           Required options:
           -c config
                input config file, see example below
           -i IAM
                PMDA name IAM, should appear in stdpmid or the -D option
                must be used to specify a domain.
           Other options:
           -d   generate an Install script for a daemon PMDA (default is
                DSO)
           -D domain
                use domain number in the generated pmns and domain.h (if -s
                is not given)
           -n pmns
                use pmns as root of the namespace (default matches -i flag)
           -o dir
                use dir for generated source code, default ./generated
           -s stdpmid
                path to stdpmid (default ../../pmns/stdpmid)
           -t topdir
                use topdir in generated GNUmakefile, default ../../..
           -v   print verbose messages about what genpmda is doing.
           Example:
               Generate an "example" PMDA using domain 99:
               genpmda -D 99 -v -i EXAMPLE -c example.conf
           Here is example.conf config file (for the required -c option):
                example {
                    metric
                }
                example.metric {
                    ##  metric            string
                    ##  pmid              EXAMPLE:CLUSTER:0
                    ##  indom             PM_INDOM_NULL
                    ##  type              PM_TYPE_STRING
                    ##  units             PMDA_PMUNITS(0,0,0,0,0,0)
                    ##  semantics         PM_SEM_DISCRETE
                    ##  briefhelptext     one line help text for example.metric.string
                    ##  helptext          long help text for example.metric.string
                    ##  helptext          This is the second line of the long help text
                    ##  helptext          and this is the third line.
                    ##  fetch             function example_string_fetch_callback
                    ##  code              atom->cp = "hello world";
                    ##  code              return 1;
                    ##  endmetric
                }
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
