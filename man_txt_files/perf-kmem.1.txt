## NAME         top
           perf-kmem - Tool to trace/measure kernel memory properties
## SYNOPSIS         top
           perf kmem [<options>] {record|stat}
## DESCRIPTION         top
           There are two variants of perf kmem:
               'perf kmem [<options>] record [<perf-record-options>] <command>' to
               record the kmem events of an arbitrary workload. Additional 'perf
               record' options may be specified after record, such as '-o' to
               change the output file name.
               'perf kmem [<options>] stat' to report kernel memory statistics.
## OPTIONS         top
           -i <file>, --input=<file>
               For stat, select the input file (default: perf.data unless
               stdin is a fifo)
           -f, --force
               Don’t do ownership validation
           -v, --verbose
               Be more verbose. (show symbol address, etc)
           --caller
               Show per-callsite statistics
           --alloc
               Show per-allocation statistics
           -s <key[,key2...]>, --sort=<key[,key2...]>
               Sort the output (default: frag,hit,bytes for slab and
               bytes,hit for page). Available sort keys are ptr, callsite,
               bytes, hit, pingpong, frag for slab and page, callsite,
               bytes, hit, order, migtype, gfp for page. This option should
               be preceded by one of the mode selection options - i.e.
               --slab, --page, --alloc and/or --caller.
           -l <num>, --line=<num>
               Print n lines only
           --raw-ip
               Print raw ip instead of symbol
           --slab
               Analyze SLAB allocator events.
           --page
               Analyze page allocator events
           --live
               Show live page stat. The perf kmem shows total allocation
               stat by default, but this option shows live (currently
               allocated) pages instead. (This option works with --page
               option only)
           --time=<start>,<stop>
               Only analyze samples within given time window:
               <start>,<stop>. Times have the format seconds.microseconds.
               If start is not given (i.e., time string is ,x.y) then
               analysis starts at the beginning of the file. If stop time is
               not given (i.e, time string is x.y,) then analysis goes to
               end of file.
