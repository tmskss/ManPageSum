    GIT-STRIPSPACE(1)              Git Manual              GIT-STRIPSPACE(1)
## NAME         top
           git-stripspace - Remove unnecessary whitespace
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git stripspace [-s | --strip-comments]
           git stripspace [-c | --comment-lines]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Read text, such as commit messages, notes, tags and branch
           descriptions, from the standard input and clean it in the manner
           used by Git.
           With no arguments, this will:
           •   remove trailing whitespace from all lines
           •   collapse multiple consecutive empty lines into one empty line
           •   remove empty lines from the beginning and end of the input
           •   add a missing \n to the last line if necessary.
           In the case where the input consists entirely of whitespace
           characters, no output will be produced.
           NOTE: This is intended for cleaning metadata, prefer the
           --whitespace=fix mode of git-apply(1) for correcting whitespace
           of patches or files in the repository.
## OPTIONS         top
           -s, --strip-comments
               Skip and remove all lines starting with comment character
               (default #).
           -c, --comment-lines
               Prepend comment character and blank to each line. Lines will
               automatically be terminated with a newline. On empty lines,
               only the comment character will be prepended.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Given the following noisy input with $ indicating the end of a
           line:
               |A brief introduction   $
               |   $
               |$
               |A new paragraph$
               |# with a commented-out line    $
               |explaining lots of stuff.$
               |$
               |# An old paragraph, also commented-out. $
               |      $
               |The end.$
               |  $
           Use git stripspace with no arguments to obtain:
               |A brief introduction$
               |$
               |A new paragraph$
               |# with a commented-out line$
               |explaining lots of stuff.$
               |$
               |# An old paragraph, also commented-out.$
               |$
               |The end.$
           Use git stripspace --strip-comments to obtain:
               |A brief introduction$
               |$
               |A new paragraph$
               |explaining lots of stuff.$
               |$
               |The end.$
