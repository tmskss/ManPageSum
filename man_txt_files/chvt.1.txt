# chvt(1) -- Linux manual page
NAME | SYNOPSIS | DESCRIPTION | OPTIONS | COLOPHON  
    CHVT(1)                  General Commands Manual                 CHVT(1)
## NAME         top
           chvt - change foreground virtual terminal
## SYNOPSIS         top
           chvt [option...]  N
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The command chvt N makes /dev/ttyN the foreground terminal.  (The
           corresponding screen is created if it did not exist yet.  To get
           rid of unused VTs, use deallocvt(1).)  The key combination
           (Ctrl-)LeftAlt-FN (with N in the range 1-12) usually has a
           similar effect.
## OPTIONS         top
           -V, --version
                  print program version and exit.
           -h, --help
                  show this text and exit.
