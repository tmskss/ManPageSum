## NAME         top
           stg-files - Show files modified by a patch
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg files [OPTIONS] [revision]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Show the files modified by a patch. The files of the topmost
           patch are shown by default. Passing the --stat option shows the
           diff statistics for the given patch. Note that this command does
           not show the files modified in the working tree and not yet
           included in the patch by a refresh command. Use the diff or
           status commands to show these files.
## OPTIONS         top
           -s, --stat
               Show patch’s diffstat
           --bare
               Print bare file names. This is useful for scripting.
