    psktool(1)                    User Commands                   psktool(1)
## NAME         top
           psktool - GnuTLS PSK tool
## SYNOPSIS         top
           psktool [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]
           All arguments must be options.
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Program  that generates random keys for use with TLS-PSK. The
           keys are stored in hexadecimal format in a key file.
## OPTIONS         top
           -d num, --debug=num
                  Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as
                  its argument.  The value of num is constrained to being:
                      in the range 0 through 9999
                  Specifies the debug level.
           -s num, --keysize=num
                  Specify the key size in bytes (default is 32-bytes or
                  256-bits).  This option takes an integer number as its
                  argument.  The value of num is constrained to being:
                      in the range 0 through 512
           -u str, --username=str
                  Specify the username to use.
           -p str, --pskfile=str
                  Specify a pre-shared key file.
                  This option will specify the pre-shared key file to store
                  the generated keys.
           --passwd
                  This is an alias for the --pskfile option.
                  NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED
           -v arg, --version=arg
                  Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is
                  `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright
                  information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.
           -h, --help
                  Display usage information and exit.
           -!, --more-help
                  Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
## EXAMPLES         top
           To add a user 'psk_identity' in keys.psk for use with GnuTLS run:
               $ ./psktool -u psk_identity -p keys.psk
               Generating a random key for user 'psk_identity'
               Key stored to keys.psk
               $ cat keys.psk
               psk_identity:88f3824b3e5659f52d00e959bacab954b6540344
               $
           This command will create keys.psk if it does not exist and will
           add user 'psk_identity'.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           One of the following exit values will be returned:
           0  (EXIT_SUCCESS)
                  Successful program execution.
           1  (EXIT_FAILURE)
                  The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
