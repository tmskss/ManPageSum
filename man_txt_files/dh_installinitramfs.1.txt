## NAME         top
           dh_installinitramfs - install initramfs hooks and setup
           maintscripts
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installinitramfs [debhelper options] [-n]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installinitramfs is a debhelper program that is responsible
           for installing Debian package provided initramfs hooks.
           If dh_installinitramfs installs or detects one or more initramfs
           hooks in the package, then it also automatically generates the
           noawait trigger update-initframfs command needed to interface
           with the Debian initramfs system.  This trigger is inserted into
           the packaging by dh_installdeb(1).
## FILES         top
           debian/package.initramfs-hook
               Assumed to be an initramfs hook that will be installed into
               usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/package in the package build
               directory. See HOOK SCRIPTS in initramfs-tools(8) for more
               information about initramfs hooks.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --no-scripts
               Do not add the update-initramfs trigger even if it seems like
               the package might need it.  The option is called --no-scripts
               for historical reasons as dh_installinitramfs would
               previously generate maintainer scripts that called update-
               initramfs -u.
               Use this option, if you need to interface with the update-
               initramfs system that is not satisfied by the noawait trigger
               (e.g. because you need the extra guarantees and head-aches of
               a await trigger).
## NOTES         top
           Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
           called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may
           cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to triggers
           file.
## SEE ALSO         top

           This program is a part of debhelper.
