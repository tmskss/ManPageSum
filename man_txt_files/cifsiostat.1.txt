    CIFSIOSTAT(1)              Linux User's Manual             CIFSIOSTAT(1)
## NAME         top
           cifsiostat - Report CIFS statistics.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           cifsiostat [ -h ] [ -k | -m ] [ -t ] [ -V ] [ --dec={ 0 | 1 | 2 }
           ] [ --human ] [ --pretty ] [ interval [ count ] ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The cifsiostat command displays statistics about read and write
           operations on CIFS filesystems.
           The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
           between each report. The first report contains statistics for the
           time since system startup (boot). Each subsequent report contains
           statistics collected during the interval since the previous
           report.  A report consists of a CIFS header row followed by a
           line of statistics for each CIFS filesystem that is mounted.  The
           count parameter can be specified in conjunction with the interval
           parameter. If the count parameter is specified, the value of
           count determines the number of reports generated at interval
           seconds apart. If the interval parameter is specified without the
           count parameter, the cifsiostat command generates reports
           continuously.
## REPORT         top
           The CIFS report provides statistics for each mounted CIFS
           filesystem.  The report shows the following fields:
           Filesystem:
                  This columns shows the mount point of the CIFS filesystem.
           rB/s (rkB/s, rMB/s)
                  Indicate the average number of bytes (kilobytes,
                  megabytes) read per second.
           wB/s (wkB/s, wMB/s)
                  Indicate the average number of bytes (kilobytes,
                  megabytes) written per second.
           rop/s  Indicate the number of 'read' operations that were issued
                  to the filesystem per second.
           wop/s  Indicate the number of 'write' operations that were issued
                  to the filesystem per second.
           fo/s   Indicate the number of open files per second.
           fc/s   Indicate the number of closed files per second.
           fd/s   Indicate the number of deleted files per second.
## OPTIONS         top
           --dec={ 0 | 1 | 2 }
                  Specify the number of decimal places to use (0 to 2,
                  default value is 2).
           -h     This option is equivalent to specifying --human --pretty.
           --human
                  Print sizes in human readable format (e.g. 1.0k, 1.2M,
                  etc.)  The units displayed with this option supersede any
                  other default units (e.g.  kilobytes, sectors...)
                  associated with the metrics.
           -k     Display statistics in kilobytes per second.
           -m     Display statistics in megabytes per second.
           --pretty
                  Make the CIFS report easier to read by a human.
           -t     Print the time for each report displayed. The timestamp
                  format may depend on the value of the S_TIME_FORMAT
                  environment variable (see below).
           -V     Print version number then exit.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           The cifsiostat command takes into account the following
           environment variables:
           S_COLORS
                  By default statistics are displayed in color when the
                  output is connected to a terminal.  Use this variable to
                  change the settings. Possible values for this variable are
                  never, always or auto (the latter is equivalent to the
                  default settings).
                  Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some
                  other color) used to display a value is not indicative of
                  any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only
                  indicates different ranges of values.
           S_COLORS_SGR
                  Specify the colors and other attributes used to display
                  statistics on the terminal.  Its value is a colon-
                  separated list of capabilities that defaults to
                  I=32;22:N=34;1:Z=34;22.  Supported capabilities are:
                  I=     SGR substring for filesystem names.
                  N=     SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.
                  Z=     SGR substring for zero values.
           S_TIME_FORMAT
                  If this variable exists and its value is ISO then the
                  current locale will be ignored when printing the date in
                  the report header. The cifsiostat command will use the ISO
                  8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp displayed
                  with option -t will also be compliant with ISO 8601
                  format.
## BUG         top
           /proc filesystem must be mounted for cifsiostat to work.
           Although cifsiostat speaks of kilobytes (kB), megabytes (MB)...,
           it actually uses kibibytes (kiB), mebibytes (MiB)...  A kibibyte
           is equal to 1024 bytes, and a mebibyte is equal to 1024
           kibibytes.
## FILE         top
           /proc/fs/cifs/Stats contains CIFS statistics.
