## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdacisco is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           extracts performance metrics from one or more Cisco routers.
           A brief description of the pmdacisco command line options
           follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                cisco.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                when pmdacisco is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
                log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
                written to the standard error instead.
           -P   By default, it is assumed that no user-level password is
                required to access the Cisco's telnet port.  If user-level
                passwords have been enabled on the Ciscos, then those
                passwords must be specified to pmdacisco.  If specified with
                the -P option, password will be used as the default user-
                level password for all Ciscos.  See also the INTERFACE
                IDENTIFICATION section below.
           -r   pmdacisco will refresh the current values for all
                performance metrics by contacting each Cisco router once
                every refresh seconds.  The default refresh is 120 seconds.
           -s   The Cisco command prompt ends with the string prompt.  The
                default value is ``>''.  The only way pmdacisco can
                synchronize the sending of commands and the parsing of
                output is by recognizing prompt as a unique string that
                comes at the end of all output, i.e. as the command prompt
                when waiting for the next command.
           -U   By default, it is assumed that no username login is required
                to access the Cisco's telnet port.  If username login has
                been enabled on the Ciscos, then the corresponding usernames
                must be specified to pmdacisco.  If specified with the -U
                option, username will be used as the default username login
                for all Ciscos.  See also the INTERFACE IDENTIFICATION
                section below.
           -M   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
           -x   Connect to the Cisco via TCP port number port rather than
                the default 23 for a telnet connection.
           For each interface, once the telnet connection is established,
           pmdacisco is willing to wait up to 5 seconds for the Cisco to
           provide a new snapshot of the requested information.  If this
           does not happen, the telnet connection is broken and no values
           are returned.  This prevents pmdacisco tying up the Cisco's
           telnet ports waiting indefinitely when the response from the
           router is not what is expected, e.g. if the format of the ``show
           int'' output changes, or the command is in error because an
           interface is no longer configured on the router.
## INTERFACE IDENTIFICATION         top
           As each Cisco router can support multiple network interfaces
           and/or multiple communications protocols, it is necessary to tell
           pmdacisco which interfaces are to be monitored.
           The host:interface-spec arguments on the command line define a
           particular interface on a particular Cisco router.  host should
           be a hostname or a ``dot-notation'' IP address that identifies
           the telnet port of a particular Cisco router.  There are several
           components of the interface-spec as follows.
           protocol
                  One of the abbreviations a, B, E, e, f, G, h, s or Vl
                  respectively for ATM, BRI (ISDN), FastEthernet, Ethernet,
                  FDDI, GigabitEthernet, HSSI, serial or Vlan.
           interface
                  Depending on the model of the Cisco, this will either be
                  an integer, e.g. s0, or an integer followed by a slash
                  (``/'') followed by a subinterface identification in one
                  of a variety of syntactic forms, e.g. e1/0, G0/0/1 or
                  s4/2.1.
                  To discover the valid interfaces on a particular Cisco,
                  connect to the telnet port (using telnet(1)) and enter the
                  command "show int" and look for the interface identifiers
                  following the keywords ``Ethernet'', ``Fddi'', ``Serial'',
                  etc.
                  Alternatively run the probe command.
           username
                  If there is a username login, and it is different to the
                  default (see -U above), it may be optionally specified
                  here by appending ``@'' and the username to the end of
                  interface-spec.
           password
                  If there is a user-level password, and it is different to
                  the default (see -P above), it may be optionally specified
                  here by appending a question mark (``?'') and the password
                  to the end of interface-spec.
           prompt If the Cisco command prompt is different to the default
                  (see -s above), it may be optionally specified here by
                  appending an exclamation mark (``!'') and the prompt to
                  the end of interface-spec.
           The following are examples of valid interface-spec arguments.
                     my-router:e1/2
                     123.456.789.0:s0
                     wancisco:f2/3?trust_me
                     somecisco:G1/0!myprompt
                     cisco34.foo.bar.com:e2?way2cool
                     mycisco:s2/2.1@mylogin
                     yourcisco:E0/0@yourlogin?yourpassword
                     mycisco:E0/0@mylogin?mypassword!myprompt
## HELPER UTILITIES         top
           The probe command may be used to discover the names of all
           interfaces for a particular Cisco router identified by host.  The
           -P argument is the same as for pmdacisco.
           The parse command takes exactly the same arguments as pmdacisco,
           but executes outside the control of any pmcd(1) and so may be
           used to diagnose problems with handling a particular Cisco router
           and/or one of its interfaces.
           Additional diagnostic verbosity may be produced using the -D
           appl0,appl1,appl2 command line option.  appl0 logs connect and
           disconnect events, login progress, high-level flow of control and
           extracted statistics.  appl1 traces all commands sent to the
           Cisco device.  appl2 logs tokenizing and parsing of the output
           from the Cisco device.  Diagnostics are generated on standard
           error as each sample is fetched and parsed.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           Cisco performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco
                # ./Remove
           pmdacisco is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
