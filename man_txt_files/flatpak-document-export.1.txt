## NAME         top
           flatpak-document-export - Export a file to a sandboxed
           application
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak document-export [OPTION...] FILE
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Creates a document id for a local file that can be exposed to
           sandboxed applications, allowing them access to files that they
           would not otherwise see. The exported files are exposed in a fuse
           filesystem at /run/user/$UID/doc/.
           This command also lets you modify the per-application permissions
           of the documents, granting or revoking access to the file on a
           per-application basis.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -u, --unique
               Don't reuse an existing document id for the file. This makes
               it safe to later remove the document when you're finished
               with it.
           -t, --transient
               The document will only exist for the length of the session.
               This is useful for temporary grants.
           -n, --noexist
               Don't require the file to exist already.
           -a, --app=APPID
               Grant read access to the specified application. The --allow
               and --forbid options can be used to grant or remove
               additional privileges. This option can be used multiple
               times.
           -r, --allow-read
               Grant read access to the applications specified with --app.
               This defaults to TRUE.
           --forbid-read
               Revoke read access for the applications specified with --app.
           -w, --allow-write
               Grant write access to the applications specified with --app.
           --forbid-write
               Revoke write access for the applications specified with
               --app.
           -d, --allow-delete
               Grant the ability to remove the document from the document
               portal to the applications specified with --app.
           --forbid-delete
               Revoke the ability to remove the document from the document
               portal from the applications specified with --app.
           -g, --allow-grant-permission
               Grant the ability to grant further permissions to the
               applications specified with --app.
           --forbid-grant-permission
               Revoke the ability to grant further permissions for the
               applications specified with --app.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
## EXAMPLES         top
           $ flatpak document-export --app=org.gnome.gedit ~/test.txt
               /run/user/1000/doc/e52f9c6a/test.txt
