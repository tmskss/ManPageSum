## DESCRIPTION         top
           ldapsearch is a shell-accessible interface to the
           ldap_search_ext(3) library call.
           ldapsearch opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and
           performs a search using specified parameters.   The filter should
           conform to the string representation for search filters as
           defined in RFC 4515.  If not provided, the default filter,
           (objectClass=*), is used.
           If ldapsearch finds one or more entries, the attributes specified
           by attrs are returned.  If * is listed, all user attributes are
           returned.  If + is listed, all operational attributes are
           returned.  If no attrs are listed, all user attributes are
           returned.  If only 1.1 is listed, no attributes will be returned.
           The search results are displayed using an extended version of
           LDIF.  Option -L controls the format of the output.
## OPTIONS         top
           -V[V]  Print version info.  If -VV is given, exit after providing
                  version info. Otherwise proceed with the specified search
           -d debuglevel
                  Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapsearch
                  must be compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option
                  to have any effect.
           -n     Show what would be done, but don't actually perform the
                  search.  Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.
           -v     Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to
                  standard output.
           -c     Continuous operation mode. Errors are reported, but
                  ldapsearch will continue with searches. The default is to
                  exit after reporting an error.  Only useful in conjunction
                  with -f.
           -u     Include the User Friendly Name form of the Distinguished
                  Name (DN) in the output.
           -t[t]  A single -t writes retrieved non-printable values to a set
                  of temporary files.  This is useful for dealing with
                  values containing non-character data such as jpegPhoto or
                  audio. A second -t writes all retrieved values to files.
           -T path
                  Write temporary files to directory specified by path
                  (default: system default tmp directory). The environment
                  variables TMPDIR, TMP, or TEMP will override the default
                  path.
           -F prefix
                  URL prefix for temporary files.  Default is file://path
                  where path is the system default tmp directory or the
                  value specified with -T.
           -A     Retrieve attributes only (no values).  This is useful when
                  you just want to see if an attribute is present in an
                  entry and are not interested in the specific values.
           -L     Search results are display in LDAP Data Interchange Format
                  detailed in ldif(5).  A single -L restricts the output to
                  LDIFv1.
                   A second -L disables comments.  A third -L disables
                  printing of the LDIF version.  The default is to use an
                  extended version of LDIF.
           -S attribute
                  Sort the entries returned based on attribute. The default
                  is not to sort entries returned.  If attribute is a zero-
                  length string (""), the entries are sorted by the
                  components of their Distinguished Name.  See ldap_sort(3)
                  for more details. Note that ldapsearch normally prints out
                  entries as it receives them. The use of the -S option
                  defeats this behavior, causing all entries to be
                  retrieved, then sorted, then printed.
           -b searchbase
                  Use searchbase as the starting point for the search
                  instead of the default.
           -s {base|one|sub|children}
                  Specify the scope of the search to be one of base, one,
                  sub, or children to specify a base object, one-level,
                  subtree, or children search.  The default is sub.  Note:
                  children scope requires LDAPv3 subordinate feature
                  extension.
           -a {never|always|search|find}
                  Specify how aliases dereferencing is done.  Should be one
                  of never, always, search, or find to specify that aliases
                  are never dereferenced, always dereferenced, dereferenced
                  when searching, or dereferenced only when locating the
                  base object for the search.  The default is to never
                  dereference aliases.
           -l timelimit
                  wait at most timelimit seconds for a search to complete.
                  A timelimit of 0 (zero) or none means no limit.  A
                  timelimit of max means the maximum integer allowable by
                  the protocol.  A server may impose a maximal timelimit
                  which only the root user may override.
           -z sizelimit
                  retrieve at most sizelimit entries for a search.  A
                  sizelimit of 0 (zero) or none means no limit.  A sizelimit
                  of max means the maximum integer allowable by the
                  protocol.  A server may impose a maximal sizelimit which
                  only the root user may override.
           -f file
                  Read a series of lines from file, performing one LDAP
                  search for each line.  In this case, the filter given on
                  the command line is treated as a pattern where the first
                  and only occurrence of %s is replaced with a line from
                  file.  Any other occurrence of the the % character in the
                  pattern will be regarded as an error.  Where it is desired
                  that the search filter include a % character, the
                  character should be encoded as \25 (see RFC 4515).  If
                  file is a single - character, then the lines are read from
                  standard input.  ldapsearch will exit when the first non-
                  successful search result is returned, unless -c is used.
           -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.
           -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.
           -D binddn
                  Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP
                  directory.  For SASL binds, the server is expected to
                  ignore this value.
           -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of
                  specifying the password on the command line.
           -w passwd
                  Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.
           -y passwdfile
                  Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password for
                  simple authentication.
           -H ldapuri
                  Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); a list of
                  URI, separated by whitespace or commas is expected; only
                  the protocol/host/port fields are allowed.  As an
                  exception, if no host/port is specified, but a DN is, the
                  DN is used to look up the corresponding host(s) using the
                  DNS SRV records, according to RFC 2782.  The DN must be a
                  non-empty sequence of AVAs whose attribute type is "dc"
                  (domain component), and must be escaped according to RFC
                  2396.
           -P {2|3}
                  Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.
           -e [!]ext[=extparam]
           -E [!]ext[=extparam]
                  Specify general extensions with -e and search extensions
                  with -E.  ´!´ indicates criticality.
                  General extensions:
                    [!]assert=<filter>    (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                    !authzid=<authzid>    ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                    [!]bauthzid           (RFC 3829 authzid control)

                    [!]relax
                    sessiontracking[=<username>]
                    abandon,cancel,ignore (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel,
                    or ignores response; if critical, doesn't wait for SIGINT.
                    not really controls)
                  Search extensions:
                    !dontUseCopy
                    [!]domainScope                       (domain scope)
                    [!]mv=<filter>                       (matched values filter)
                    [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                    [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                    [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                    [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                            rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)
                    [!]vlv=<before>/<after>(/<offset>/<count>|:<value>)  (virtual list view)
                    [!]deref=derefAttr:attr[,attr[...]][;derefAttr:attr[,attr[...]]]
                    [!]<oid>[=:<value>|::<b64value>]
           -o opt[=optparam]
                  Specify any ldap.conf(5) option or one of the following:
                    nettimeout=<timeout>  (in seconds, or "none" or "max")
                    ldif_wrap=<width>     (in columns, or "no" for no wrapping)
           -O security-properties
                  Specify SASL security properties.
           -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always prompt.  Default is
                  to prompt only as needed.
           -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.
           -N     Do not use reverse DNS to canonicalize SASL host name.
           -U authcid
                  Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of
                  the ID depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.
           -R realm
                  Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The
                  form of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism
                  used.
           -X authzid
                  Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL bind.
                  authzid must be one of the following formats:
                  dn:<distinguished name> or u:<username>
           -Y mech
                  Specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication.
                  If it's not specified, the program will choose the best
                  mechanism the server knows.
           -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended
                  operation. If you use -ZZ, the command will require the
                  operation to be successful.
## OUTPUT FORMAT         top
           If one or more entries are found, each entry is written to
           standard output in LDAP Data Interchange Format or ldif(5):
               version: 1
               # bjensen, example, net
               dn: uid=bjensen,dc=example,dc=net
               objectClass: person
               objectClass: dcObject
               uid: bjensen
               cn: Barbara Jensen
               sn: Jensen
               ...
           If the -t option is used, the URI of a temporary file is used in
           place of the actual value.  If the -A option is given, only the
           "attributename" part is written.
## EXAMPLE         top
           The following command:
               ldapsearch -LLL "(sn=smith)" cn sn telephoneNumber
           will perform a subtree search (using the default search base and
           other parameters defined in ldap.conf(5)) for entries with a
           surname (sn) of smith.  The common name (cn), surname (sn) and
           telephoneNumber values will be retrieved and printed to standard
           output.  The output might look something like this if two entries
           are found:
               dn: uid=jts,dc=example,dc=com
               cn: John Smith
               cn: John T. Smith
               sn: Smith
               sn;lang-en: Smith
               sn;lang-de: Schmidt
               telephoneNumber: 1 555 123-4567
               dn: uid=sss,dc=example,dc=com
               cn: Steve Smith
               cn: Steve S. Smith
               sn: Smith
               sn;lang-en: Smith
               sn;lang-de: Schmidt
               telephoneNumber: 1 555 765-4321
           The command:
               ldapsearch -LLL -u -t "(uid=xyz)" jpegPhoto audio
           will perform a subtree search using the default search base for
           entries with user id of "xyz".  The user friendly form of the
           entry's DN will be output after the line that contains the DN
           itself, and the jpegPhoto and audio values will be retrieved and
           written to temporary files.  The output might look like this if
           one entry with one value for each of the requested attributes is
           found:
               dn: uid=xyz,dc=example,dc=com
               ufn: xyz, example, com
               audio:< file:///tmp/ldapsearch-audio-a19924
               jpegPhoto:< file:///tmp/ldapsearch-jpegPhoto-a19924
           This command:
               ldapsearch -LLL -s one -b "c=US" "(o=University*)" o description
           will perform a one-level search at the c=US level for all entries
           whose organization name (o) begins with University.  The
           organization name and description attribute values will be
           retrieved and printed to standard output, resulting in output
           similar to this:
               dn: o=University of Alaska Fairbanks,c=US
               o: University of Alaska Fairbanks
               description: Naturally Inspiring
               description: leaf node only
               dn: o=University of Colorado at Boulder,c=US
               o: University of Colorado at Boulder

## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-
           zero exit status and a diagnostic message being written to
           standard error.
