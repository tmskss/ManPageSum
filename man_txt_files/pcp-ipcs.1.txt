           pcp-ipcs - provide information on IPC facilities
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] ipcs [-luV?] [output-format]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-ipcs provides information on the inter-process communication
           facilities for which the calling process has read access.
## OPTIONS         top
           When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
           -O/--origin, -Z/--timezone and several other pcp options become
           indirectly available; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete
           description of these options.
           The additional command line options available for pcp-ipcs are:
           -V, --version
                  Display version information and exit.
           -?, --help
                  Display the usage message and exit.
       Output formats
           -l, --limits
                  Show resource limits.
           -u, --summary
                  Show status summary.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
