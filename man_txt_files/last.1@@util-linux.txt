    LAST(1)                       User Commands                      LAST(1)
## NAME         top
           last, lastb - show a listing of last logged in users
## SYNOPSIS         top
           last [options] [username...] [tty...]
           lastb [options] [username...] [tty...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           last searches back through the /var/log/wtmp file (or the file
           designated by the -f option) and displays a list of all users
           logged in (and out) since that file was created. One or more
           usernames and/or ttys can be given, in which case last will show
           only the entries matching those arguments. Names of ttys can be
           abbreviated, thus last 0 is the same as last tty0.
           When catching a SIGINT signal (generated by the interrupt key,
           usually control-C) or a SIGQUIT signal, last will show how far it
           has searched through the file; in the case of the SIGINT signal
           last will then terminate.
           The pseudo user reboot logs in each time the system is rebooted.
           Thus last reboot will show a log of all the reboots since the log
           file was created.
           lastb is the same as last, except that by default it shows a log
           of the /var/log/btmp file, which contains all the bad login
           attempts.
## OPTIONS         top
           -a, --hostlast
               Display the hostname in the last column. Useful in
               combination with the --dns option.
           -d, --dns
               For non-local logins, Linux stores not only the host name of
               the remote host, but its IP number as well. This option
               translates the IP number back into a hostname.
           -f, --file file
               Tell last to use a specific file instead of /var/log/wtmp.
               The --file option can be given multiple times, and all of the
               specified files will be processed.
           -F, --fulltimes
               Print full login and logout times and dates.
           -i, --ip
               Like --dns , but displays the host’s IP number instead of the
               name.
           -number; -n, --limit number
               Tell last how many lines to show.
           -p, --present time
               Display the users who were present at the specified time.
               This is like using the options --since and --until together
               with the same time.
           -R, --nohostname
               Suppresses the display of the hostname field.
           -s, --since time
               Display the state of logins since the specified time. This is
               useful, e.g., to easily determine who was logged in at a
               particular time. The option is often combined with --until.
           -t, --until time
               Display the state of logins until the specified time.
           --time-format format
               Define the output timestamp format to be one of notime,
               short, full, or iso. The notime variant will not print any
               timestamps at all, short is the default, and full is the same
               as the --fulltimes option. The iso variant will display the
               timestamp in ISO-8601 format. The ISO format contains
               timezone information, making it preferable when printouts are
               investigated outside of the system.
           -w, --fullnames
               Display full user names and domain names in the output.
           -x, --system
               Display the system shutdown entries and run level changes.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## TIME FORMATS         top
           The options that take the time argument understand the following
           formats:

## FILES         top
           /var/log/wtmp, /var/log/btmp
## NOTES         top
           The files wtmp and btmp might not be found. The system only logs
           information in these files if they are present. This is a local
           configuration issue. If you want the files to be used, they can
           be created with a simple touch(1) command (for example, touch
           /var/log/wtmp).
           An empty entry is a valid type of wtmp entry. It means that an
           empty file or file with zeros is not interpreted as an error.
           The utmp file format uses fixed sizes of strings, which means
           that very long strings are impossible to store in the file and
           impossible to display by last. The usual limits are 32 bytes for
           a user and line name and 256 bytes for a hostname.
