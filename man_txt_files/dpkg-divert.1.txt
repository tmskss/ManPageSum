    dpkg-divert(1)                 dpkg suite                 dpkg-divert(1)
## NAME         top
           dpkg-divert - override a package's version of a file
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dpkg-divert [option...]  command
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dpkg-divert is the utility used to set up and update the list of
           diversions.
           File diversions are a way of forcing dpkg(1) not to install a
           file into its location, but to a diverted location. Diversions
           can be used through the Debian package scripts to move a file
           away when it causes a conflict. System administrators can also
           use it to override some package's configuration file, or whenever
           some files (which aren't marked as “conffiles”) need to be
           preserved by dpkg, when installing a newer version of a package
           which contains those files.
## COMMANDS         top
           [--add] file
               Add a diversion for file.  The file is currently not renamed,
               see --rename.
           --remove file
               Remove a diversion for file.  The file is currently not
               renamed, see --rename.
           --list [glob-pattern]
               List all diversions, or ones matching glob-pattern.
           --listpackage file
               Print the name of the package that diverts file (since dpkg
               1.15.0).  Prints LOCAL if file is locally diverted and
               nothing if file is not diverted.
           --truename file
               Print the real name for a diverted file.
## OPTIONS         top
           --admindir directory
               Set the administrative directory to directory.  Defaults to
               «/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» if DPKG_ADMINDIR has not been set.
           --instdir directory
               Set the installation directory, which refers to the directory
               where packages get installed (since dpkg 1.19.2).  Defaults
               to «/» if DPKG_ROOT has not been set.
           --root directory
               Set the root directory to directory, which sets the
               installation directory to «directory» and the administrative
               directory to «directory/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» (since dpkg
               1.19.2) if DPKG_ROOT has not been set.
           --divert divert-to
               divert-to is the location where the versions of file, as
               provided by other packages, will be diverted.
           --local
               Specifies that all packages' versions of this file are
               diverted.  This means, that there are no exceptions, and
               whatever package is installed, the file is diverted. This can
               be used by an admin to install a locally modified version.
           --package package
               package is the name of a package whose copy of file will not
               be diverted. i.e. file will be diverted for all packages
               except package.
           --quiet
               Quiet mode, i.e. no verbose output.
           --rename
               Actually move the file aside (or back). dpkg-divert will
               abort operation in case the destination file already exists.
               This is the common behavior used for diversions of files from
               the non-Essential package set (see --no-rename for more
               details).
           --no-rename
               Specifies that the file should not be renamed while adding or
               removing the diversion into the database (since dpkg 1.19.1).
               This is intended for diversions of files from the Essential
               package set, where the temporary disappearance of the
               original file is not acceptable, as it can render the system
               non-functional.  This is the default behavior, but that will
               change in the dpkg 1.20.x cycle.
           --test
               Test mode, i.e. don't actually perform any changes, just
               demonstrate.
           -?, --help
               Show the usage message and exit.
           --version
               Show the version and exit.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0   The requested action was successfully performed.
           2   Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
               usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to
               the database, memory allocations, etc.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           DPKG_ROOT
               If set and the --instdir or --root options have not been
               specified, it will be used as the filesystem root directory
               (since dpkg 1.19.2).
           DPKG_ADMINDIR
               If set and the --admindir or --root options have not been
               specified, it will be used as the dpkg data directory.
           DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE
               If set and the --local and --package options have not been
               specified, dpkg-divert will use it as the package name.
           DPKG_DEBUG
               Sets the debug mask (since dpkg 1.21.10) from an octal value.
               The currently accepted flags are described in the dpkg
               --debug option, but not all these flags might have an effect
               on this program.
           DPKG_COLORS
               Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
               accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.
## FILES         top
           /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/diversions
               File which contains the current list of diversions of the
               system. It is located in the dpkg administration directory,
               along with other files important to dpkg, such as status or
               available.
               Note: dpkg-divert preserves the old copy of this file, with
               extension -old, before replacing it with the new one.
## NOTES         top
           When adding, default is --local and --divert original.distrib.
           When removing, --package or --local and --divert must match if
           specified.
           Directories can't be diverted with dpkg-divert.
           Care should be taken when diverting shared libraries, ldconfig(8)
           creates a symbolic link based on the DT_SONAME field embedded in
           the library.  Because ldconfig does not honor diverts (only dpkg
           does), the symlink may end up pointing at the diverted library,
           if a diverted library has the same SONAME as the undiverted one.
## EXAMPLES         top
           To divert all copies of a /usr/bin/example to
           /usr/bin/example.foo, i.e. directs all packages providing
           /usr/bin/example to install it as /usr/bin/example.foo,
           performing the rename if required:
            dpkg-divert --divert /usr/bin/example.foo --rename /usr/bin/example
           To remove that diversion:
            dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/bin/example
           To divert any package trying to install /usr/bin/example to
           /usr/bin/example.foo, except your own wibble package:
            dpkg-divert --package wibble --divert /usr/bin/example.foo \
               --rename /usr/bin/example
           To remove that diversion:
            dpkg-divert --package wibble --rename --remove /usr/bin/example
