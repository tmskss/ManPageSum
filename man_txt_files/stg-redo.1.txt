## NAME         top
           stg-redo - Undo the last undo operation
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg redo [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           If the last command was an undo, the patch stack state will be
           reset to its state before the undo. Consecutive redos will undo
           the effects of consecutive invocations of stg-undo(1).
           It is an error to redo if the last stack-modifying command was
           not an undo.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n <n>, --number=<n>
               Undo the last <n> undos
           --hard
               Discard changes in the index and worktree
