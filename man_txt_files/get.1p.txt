## NAME         top
           get — get a version of an SCCS file (DEVELOPMENT)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           get [-begkmnlLpst] [-c cutoff] [-i list] [-r SID] [-x list] file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The get utility shall generate a text file from each named SCCS
           file according to the specifications given by its options.
           The generated text shall normally be written into a file called
           the g-file whose name is derived from the SCCS filename by simply
           removing the leading "s.".
## OPTIONS         top
           The get utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported:
           -r SID    Indicate the SCCS Identification String (SID) of the
                     version (delta) of an SCCS file to be retrieved. The
                     table shows, for the most useful cases, what version of
                     an SCCS file is retrieved (as well as the SID of the
                     version to be eventually created by delta if the -e
                     option is also used), as a function of the SID
                     specified.
           -c cutoff Indicate the cutoff date-time, in the form:
                         YY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS]]]]]
                     For the YY component, values in the range [69,99] shall
                     refer to years 1969 to 1999 inclusive, and values in
                     the range [00,68] shall refer to years 2000 to 2068
                     inclusive.
                     Note:  It is expected that in a future version of this
                            standard the default century inferred from a
                            2-digit year will change. (This would apply to
                            all commands accepting a 2-digit year as input.)
                     No changes (deltas) to the SCCS file that were created
                     after the specified cutoff date-time shall be included
                     in the generated text file. Units omitted from the
                     date-time default to their maximum possible values; for
                     example, -c 7502 is equivalent to -c 750228235959.
                     Any number of non-numeric characters may separate the
                     various 2-digit pieces of the cutoff date-time. This
                     feature allows the user to specify a cutoff date in the
                     form: -c "77/2/2 9:22:25".
           -e        Indicate that the get is for the purpose of editing or
                     making a change (delta) to the SCCS file via a
                     subsequent use of delta.  The -e option used in a get
                     for a particular version (SID) of the SCCS file shall
                     prevent further get commands from editing on the same
                     SID until delta is executed or the j (joint edit) flag
                     is set in the SCCS file. Concurrent use of get -e for
                     different SIDs is always allowed.
                     If the g-file generated by get with a -e option is
                     accidentally ruined in the process of editing, it may
                     be regenerated by re-executing the get command with the
                     -k option in place of the -e option.
                     SCCS file protection specified via the ceiling, floor,
                     and authorized user list stored in the SCCS file shall
                     be enforced when the -e option is used.
           -b        Use with the -e option to indicate that the new delta
                     should have an SID in a new branch as shown in the
                     table below. This option shall be ignored if the b flag
                     is not present in the file or if the retrieved delta is
                     not a leaf delta. (A leaf delta is one that has no
                     successors on the SCCS file tree.)
                     Note:  A branch delta may always be created from a non-
                            leaf delta.
           -i list   Indicate a list of deltas to be included (forced to be
                     applied) in the creation of the generated file. The
                     list has the following syntax:
                         <list> ::= <range> | <list> , <range>
                         <range> ::= SID | SID - SID
                     SID, the SCCS Identification of a delta, may be in any
                     form shown in the ``SID Specified'' column of the table
                     in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section, except that the
                     result of supplying a partial SID is unspecified. A
                     diagnostic message shall be written if the first SID in
                     the range is not an ancestor of the second SID in the
                     range.
           -x list   Indicate a list of deltas to be excluded (forced not to
                     be applied) in the creation of the generated file. See
                     the -i option for the list format.
           -k        Suppress replacement of identification keywords (see
                     below) in the retrieved text by their value. The -k
                     option shall be implied by the -e option.
           -l        Write a delta summary into an l-file.
           -L        Write a delta summary to standard output. All
                     informative output that normally is written to standard
                     output shall be written to standard error instead,
                     unless the -s option is used, in which case it shall be
                     suppressed.
           -p        Write the text retrieved from the SCCS file to the
                     standard output. No g-file shall be created. All
                     informative output that normally goes to the standard
                     output shall go to standard error instead, unless the
                     -s option is used, in which case it shall disappear.
           -s        Suppress all informative output normally written to
                     standard output.  However, fatal error messages (which
                     shall always be written to the standard error) shall
                     remain unaffected.
           -m        Precede each text line retrieved from the SCCS file by
                     the SID of the delta that inserted the text line in the
                     SCCS file. The format shall be:
                         "%s\t%s", <SID>, <text line>
           -n        Precede each generated text line with the %M%
                     identification keyword value (see below). The format
                     shall be:
                         "%s\t%s", <%M% value>, <text line>
                     When both the -m and -n options are used, the
                     <text line> shall be replaced by the -m option-
                     generated format.
           -g        Suppress the actual retrieval of text from the SCCS
                     file. It is primarily used to generate an l-file, or to
                     verify the existence of a particular SID.
           -t        Use to access the most recently created (top) delta in
                     a given release (for example, -r 1), or release and
                     level (for example, -r 1.2).
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of an existing SCCS file or a directory. If
                     file is a directory, the get utility shall behave as
                     though each file in the directory were specified as a
                     named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component
                     of the pathname does not begin with s.)  and unreadable
                     files shall be silently ignored.
                     If exactly one file operand appears, and it is '-', the
                     standard input shall be read; each line of the standard
                     input is taken to be the name of an SCCS file to be
                     processed. Non-SCCS files and unreadable files shall be
                     silently ignored.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be a text file used only if the file
           operand is specified as '-'.  Each line of the text file shall be
           interpreted as an SCCS pathname.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The SCCS files shall be files of an unspecified format.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           get:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error, and informative messages written to
                     standard output (or standard error, if the -p option is
                     used).
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
           TZ        Determine the timezone in which the times and dates
                     written in the SCCS file are evaluated. If the TZ
                     variable is unset or NULL, an unspecified system
                     default timezone is used.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           For each file processed, get shall write to standard output the
           SID being accessed and the number of lines retrieved from the
           SCCS file, in the following format:
               "%s\n%d lines\n", <SID>, <number of lines>
           If the -e option is used, the SID of the delta to be made shall
           appear after the SID accessed and before the number of lines
           generated, in the POSIX locale:
               "%s\nnew delta %s\n%d lines\n", <SID accessed>,
                   <SID to be made>, <number of lines>
           If there is more than one named file or if a directory or
           standard input is named, each pathname shall be written before
           each of the lines shown in one of the preceding formats:
               "\n%s:\n", <pathname>
           If the -L option is used, a delta summary shall be written
           following the format specified below for l-files.
           If the -i option is used, included deltas shall be listed
           following the notation, in the POSIX locale:
               "Included:\n"
           If the -x option is used, excluded deltas shall be listed
           following the notation, in the POSIX locale:
               "Excluded:\n"
           If the -p or -L options are specified, the standard output shall
           consist of the text retrieved from the SCCS file.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages,
           except if the -p or -L options are specified, it shall include
           all informative messages normally sent to standard output.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           Several auxiliary files may be created by get.  These files are
           known generically as the g-file, l-file, p-file, and z-file.  The
           letter before the <hyphen-minus> is called the tag.  An auxiliary
           filename shall be formed from the SCCS filename: the application
           shall ensure that the last component of all SCCS filenames is of
           the form s.module-name; the auxiliary files shall be named by
           replacing the leading s with the tag. The g-file shall be an
           exception to this scheme: the g-file is named by removing the s.
           prefix. For example, for s.xyz.c, the auxiliary filenames would
           be xyz.c, l.xyz.c, p.xyz.c, and z.xyz.c, respectively.
           The g-file, which contains the generated text, shall be created
           in the current directory (unless the -p option is used). A g-file
           shall be created in all cases, whether or not any lines of text
           were generated by the get.  It shall be owned by the real user.
           If the -k option is used or implied, the g-file shall be writable
           by the owner only (read-only for everyone else); otherwise, it
           shall be read-only. Only the real user need have write permission
           in the current directory.
           The l-file shall contain a table showing which deltas were
           applied in generating the retrieved text. The l-file shall be
           created in the current directory if the -l option is used; it
           shall be read-only and it is owned by the real user.  Only the
           real user need have write permission in the current directory.
           Lines in the l-file shall have the following format:
               "%c%c%c %s\t%s %s\n", <code1>, <code2>, <code3>,
                   <SID>, <date-time>, <login>
           where the entries are:
           <code1>   A <space> if the delta was applied; '*' otherwise.
           <code2>   A <space> if the delta was applied or was not applied
                     and ignored; '*' if the delta was not applied and was
                     not ignored.
           <code3>   A character indicating a special reason why the delta
                     was or was not applied:
                     I     Included.
                     X     Excluded.
                     C     Cut off (by a -c option).
           <date-time>
                     Date and time (using the format of the date utility's
                     %y/%m/%d %T conversion specification format) of
                     creation.
           <login>   Login name of person who created delta.
           The comments and MR data shall follow on subsequent lines,
           indented one <tab>.  A blank line shall terminate each entry.
           The p-file shall be used to pass information resulting from a get
           with a -e option along to delta.  Its contents shall also be used
           to prevent a subsequent execution of get with a -e option for the
           same SID until delta is executed or the joint edit flag, j, is
           set in the SCCS file. The p-file shall be created in the
           directory containing the SCCS file and the application shall
           ensure that the effective user has write permission in that
           directory. It shall be writable by owner only, and owned by the
           effective user. Each line in the p-file shall have the following
           format:
               "%s %s %s %s%s%s\n", <g-file SID>,
                   <SID of new delta>, <login-name of real user>,
                   <date-time>, <i-value>, <x-value>
           where <i‐value> uses the format "" if no -i option was specified,
           and shall use the format:
               " -i%s", <-i option option-argument>
           if a -i option was specified and <x‐value> uses the format "" if
           no -x option was specified, and shall use the format:
               " -x%s", <-x option option-argument>
           if a -x option was specified. There can be an arbitrary number of
           lines in the p-file at any time; no two lines shall have the same
           new delta SID.
           The z-file shall serve as a lock-out mechanism against
           simultaneous updates. Its contents shall be the binary process ID
           of the command (that is, get) that created it. The z-file shall
           be created in the directory containing the SCCS file for the
           duration of get.  The same protection restrictions as those for
           the p-file shall apply for the z-file.  The z-file shall be
           created read-only.

           *       R, L, B, and S are the release, level, branch, and
                   sequence components of the SID, respectively; m means
                   maximum. Thus, for example, R.mL means ``the maximum
                   level number within release R''; R.L.(mB+1).1 means ``the
                   first sequence number on the new branch (that is, maximum
                   branch number plus one) of level L within release R''.
                   Note that if the SID specified is of the form R.L, R.L.B,
                   or R.L.B.S, each of the specified components shall exist.
           **      hR is the highest existing release that is lower than the
                   specified, nonexistent, release R.
           ***     This is used to force creation of the first delta in a
                   new release.
           †       The -b option is effective only if the b flag is present
                   in the file. An entry of '-' means ``irrelevant''.
           ‡       This case applies if the d (default SID) flag is not
                   present in the file. If the d flag is present in the
                   file, then the SID obtained from the d flag is
                   interpreted as if it had been specified on the command
                   line.  Thus, one of the other cases in this table
                   applies.
       System Date and Time
           When a g-file is generated, the creation time of deltas in the
           SCCS file may be taken into account. If any of these times are
           apparently in the future, the behavior is unspecified.
       Identification Keywords
           Identifying information shall be inserted into the text retrieved
           from the SCCS file by replacing identification keywords with
           their value wherever they occur. The following keywords may be
           used in the text stored in an SCCS file:
           %M%       Module name: either the value of the m flag in the
                     file, or if absent, the name of the SCCS file with the
                     leading s.  removed.
           %I%       SCCS identification (SID) (%R%.%L% or %R%.%L%.%B%.%S%)
                     of the retrieved text.
           %R%       Release.
           %L%       Level.
           %B%       Branch.
           %S%       Sequence.
           %D%       Current date (YY/MM/DD).
           %H%       Current date (MM/DD/YY).
           %T%       Current time (HH:MM:SS).
           %E%       Date newest applied delta was created (YY/MM/DD).
           %G%       Date newest applied delta was created (MM/DD/YY).
           %U%       Time newest applied delta was created (HH:MM:SS).
           %Y%       Module type: value of the t flag in the SCCS file.
           %F%       SCCS filename.
           %P%       SCCS absolute pathname.
           %Q%       The value of the q flag in the file.
           %C%       Current line number. This keyword is intended for
                     identifying messages output by the program, such as
                     ``this should not have happened'' type errors. It is
                     not intended to be used on every line to provide
                     sequence numbers.
           %Z%       The four-character string "@(#)" recognizable by what.
           %W%       A shorthand notation for constructing what strings:
                         %W%=%Z%%M%<tab>%I%
           %A%       Another shorthand notation for constructing what
                     strings:
                         %A%=%Z%%Y%%M%%I%%Z%
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           Problems can arise if the system date and time have been modified
           (for example, put forward and then back again, or unsynchronized
           clocks across a network) and can also arise when different values
           of the TZ environment variable are used.
           Problems of a similar nature can also arise for the operation of
           the delta utility, which compares the previous file body against
           the working file as part of its normal operation.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
