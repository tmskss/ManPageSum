    GIT-PATCH-ID(1)                Git Manual                GIT-PATCH-ID(1)
## NAME         top
           git-patch-id - Compute unique ID for a patch
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git patch-id [--stable | --unstable | --verbatim]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Read a patch from the standard input and compute the patch ID for
           it.
           A "patch ID" is nothing but a sum of SHA-1 of the file diffs
           associated with a patch, with line numbers ignored. As such, it’s
           "reasonably stable", but at the same time also reasonably unique,
           i.e., two patches that have the same "patch ID" are almost
           guaranteed to be the same thing.
           The main usecase for this command is to look for likely duplicate
           commits.
           When dealing with git diff-tree output, it takes advantage of the
           fact that the patch is prefixed with the object name of the
           commit, and outputs two 40-byte hexadecimal strings. The first
           string is the patch ID, and the second string is the commit ID.
           This can be used to make a mapping from patch ID to commit ID.
## OPTIONS         top
           --verbatim
               Calculate the patch-id of the input as it is given, do not
               strip any whitespace.
                   This is the default if patchid.verbatim is true.
           --stable
               Use a "stable" sum of hashes as the patch ID. With this
               option:
               •   Reordering file diffs that make up a patch does not
                   affect the ID. In particular, two patches produced by
                   comparing the same two trees with two different settings
                   for "-O<orderfile>" result in the same patch ID
                   signature, thereby allowing the computed result to be
                   used as a key to index some meta-information about the
                   change between the two trees;
               •   Result is different from the value produced by git 1.9
                   and older or produced when an "unstable" hash (see
                   --unstable below) is configured - even when used on a
                   diff output taken without any use of "-O<orderfile>",
                   thereby making existing databases storing such "unstable"
                   or historical patch-ids unusable.
               •   All whitespace within the patch is ignored and does not
                   affect the id.
                       This is the default if patchid.stable is set to true.
           --unstable
               Use an "unstable" hash as the patch ID. With this option, the
               result produced is compatible with the patch-id value
               produced by git 1.9 and older and whitespace is ignored.
               Users with pre-existing databases storing patch-ids produced
               by git 1.9 and older (who do not deal with reordered patches)
               may want to use this option.
                   This is the default.
