## NAME         top
           ipcmk - make various IPC resources
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ipcmk [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ipcmk allows you to create System V inter-process communication
           (IPC) objects: shared memory segments, message queues, and
           semaphore arrays.
## OPTIONS         top
           Resources can be specified with these options:
           -M, --shmem size
               Create a shared memory segment of size bytes. The size
               argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB
               (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, etc. (the "iB"
               is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the
               suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, etc.
           -Q, --queue
               Create a message queue.
           -S, --semaphore number
               Create a semaphore array with number of elements.
           Other options are:
           -p, --mode mode
               Access permissions for the resource. Default is 0644.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
