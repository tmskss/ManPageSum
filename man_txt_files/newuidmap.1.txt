    NEWUIDMAP(1)                  User Commands                 NEWUIDMAP(1)
## NAME         top
           newuidmap - set the uid mapping of a user namespace
## SYNOPSIS         top
           newuidmap pid uid loweruid count [uid loweruid count [ ... ]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The newuidmap sets /proc/[pid]/uid_map based on its command line
           arguments and the uids allowed. Subuid delegation can either be
           managed via /etc/subuid or through the configured NSS subid
           module. These options are mutually exclusive.
           Note that the root user is not exempted from the requirement for
           a valid /etc/subuid entry.
           After the pid argument, newuidmap expects sets of 3 integers:
           uid
               Beginning of the range of UIDs inside the user namespace.
           loweruid
               Beginning of the range of UIDs outside the user namespace.
           count
               Length of the ranges (both inside and outside the user
               namespace).
           newuidmap verifies that the caller is the owner of the process
           indicated by pid and that for each of the above sets, each of the
           UIDs in the range [loweruid, loweruid+count) is allowed to the
           caller according to /etc/subuid before setting
           /proc/[pid]/uid_map.
           Note that newuidmap may be used only once for a given process.
           Instead of an integer process id, the first argument may be
           specified as fd:N, where the integer N is the file descriptor
           number for the calling process's opened file for /proc/[pid[. In
           this case, newuidmap will use openat(2) to open the uid_map file
           under that directory, avoiding a TOCTTOU in case the process
           exits and the pid is immediately reused.
## OPTIONS         top
           There currently are no options to the newuidmap command.
## FILES         top
           /etc/subuid
               List of user's subordinate user IDs.
           /proc/[pid]/uid_map
               Mapping of uids from one between user namespaces.
