## NAME         top
           stg-squash - Squash two or more patches into one
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg squash [OPTIONS] <patch>...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Squash two or more patches, creating one patch with their
           combined changes.
           The squash process, at a high level:
            1. Pop all the given patches, plus any other patches on top of
               them.
            2. Push the given patches in the order they were given on the
               command line. This establishes a tree containing the combined
               changes from the given patches.
            3. Replace given patches with a new, squashed patch.
            4. Allow the user to interactively edit the commit message of
               the new, squashed patch.
            5. Push other patches that were popped in step (1), if any.
           Conflicts can occur whenever a patch is pushed; this is, in steps
           (2) and (5). If conflicts occur, the squash command will halt
           such that the conflicts may be resolved manually.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n <name>, --name=<name>
               Use <name> for the squashed patch
           -e, --edit
               Invoke editor for patch description
           -d, --diff
               Show diff when editing patch description
           -m <message>, --message=<message>
               Use message instead of invoking the editor
           -f <path>, --file=<path>
               Use the contents of file instead of invoking the editor. Use
               "-" to read from stdin.
           --no-verify
               Disable commit-msg hook
           -s[=<value>], --signoff[=<value>]
               Add "Signed-off-by" message trailer.
               The value is optional and defaults to the committer name and
               email. This option may be provided multiple times.
           --ack[=<value>]
               Add "Acked-by" message trailer.
               The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
               and email. This option may be provided multiple times.
           --review[=<value>]
               Add "Reviewed-by" message trailer.
               The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
               and email. This option may be provided multiple times.
           --author=<name-and-email>
               Set the author "name <email>"
           --authname=<name>
               Set the author name
           --authemail=<email>
               Set the author email
           --authdate=<date>
               Set the date the patch was authored.
               Use "now" to use the current time and date.
           --committer-date-is-author-date
               Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
               the author date of the commit as the committer date.
           --save-template=<file>
               Instead of running the command, just write the patch
               description to FILE, and exit. (If FILE is "-", write to
               stdout.)
               When driving StGit from another program, it may be useful to
               first call a command with --save-template, then let the user
               edit the message, and then call the same command with --file.
