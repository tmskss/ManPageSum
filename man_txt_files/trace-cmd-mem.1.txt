## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-mem - show memory usage of certain kmem events
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd mem [OPTIONS][input-file]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) mem requires a trace-cmd record that enabled the
           following events:
               kmalloc
               kmalloc_node
               kfree
               kmem_cache_alloc
               kmem_cache_alloc_node
               kmem_cache_alloc_free
           It then reads the amount requested and the ammount freed as well
           as the functions that called the allocation. It then reports the
           final amount of bytes requested and allocated, along with the
           total amount allocated and requested, as well as the max
           allocation and requested during the run. It reports the amount of
           wasted bytes (allocated - requested) that was not freed, as well
           as the max wasted amount during the run. The list is sorted by
           descending order of wasted bytes after the run.

               By default, trace-cmd hist will read the file trace.dat. But
               the -i option open up the given input-file instead. Note, the
               input file may also be specified as the last item on the
               command line.
