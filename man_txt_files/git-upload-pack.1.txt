    GIT-UPLOAD-PACK(1)             Git Manual             GIT-UPLOAD-PACK(1)
## NAME         top
           git-upload-pack - Send objects packed back to git-fetch-pack
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git-upload-pack [--[no-]strict] [--timeout=<n>] [--stateless-rpc]
                             [--advertise-refs] <directory>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Invoked by git fetch-pack, learns what objects the other side is
           missing, and sends them after packing.
           This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The
           UI for the protocol is on the git fetch-pack side, and the
           program pair is meant to be used to pull updates from a remote
           repository. For push operations, see git send-pack.
## OPTIONS         top
           --[no-]strict
               Do not try <directory>/.git/ if <directory> is no Git
               directory.
           --timeout=<n>
               Interrupt transfer after <n> seconds of inactivity.
           --stateless-rpc
               Perform only a single read-write cycle with stdin and stdout.
               This fits with the HTTP POST request processing model where a
               program may read the request, write a response, and must
               exit.
           --http-backend-info-refs
               Used by git-http-backend(1) to serve up
               $GIT_URL/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack requests. See
               "Smart Clients" in gitprotocol-http(5) and "HTTP Transport"
               in the gitprotocol-v2(5) documentation. Also understood by
               git-receive-pack(1).
           <directory>
               The repository to sync from.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           GIT_PROTOCOL
               Internal variable used for handshaking the wire protocol.
               Server admins may need to configure some transports to allow
               this variable to be passed. See the discussion in git(1).
