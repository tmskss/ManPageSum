## NAME         top
           ppdi - import ppd files (deprecated)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ppdi [ -I include-directory ] [ -o source-file ] ppd-file [ ...
           ppd-file ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ppdi imports one or more PPD files into a PPD compiler source
           file.  Multiple languages of the same PPD file are merged into a
           single printer definition to facilitate accurate changes for all
           localizations.  This program is deprecated and will be removed in
           a future release of CUPS.
## OPTIONS         top
           ppdi supports the following options:
           -I include-directory
                Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I
                options can be supplied to add additional directories.
           -o source-file
                Specifies the PPD source file to update.  If the source file
                does not exist, a new source file is created.  Otherwise the
                existing file is merged with the new PPD file(s) on the
                command-line.  If no source file is specified, the filename
                ppdi.drv is used.
## NOTES         top
           PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a
           future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP
           can be supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
