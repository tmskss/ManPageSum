## NAME         top
           ppdc - cups ppd compiler (deprecated)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ppdc [ -D name[=value] ] [ -I include-directory ] [ -c message-
           catalog ] [ -d output-directory ] [ -l language(s) ] [ -m ] [ -t
           ] [ -v ] [ -z ] [ --cr ] [ --crlf ] [ --lf ] source-file
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ppdc compiles PPDC source files into one or more PPD files.  This
           program is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of
           CUPS.
## OPTIONS         top
           ppdc supports the following options:
           -D name[=value]
                Sets the named variable for use in the source file.  It is
                equivalent to using the #define directive in the source
                file.
           -I include-directory
                Specifies an alternate include directory.  Multiple -I
                options can be supplied to add additional directories.
           -c message-catalog
                Specifies a single message catalog file in GNU gettext
                (filename.po) or Apple strings (filename.strings) format to
                be used for localization.
           -d output-directory
                Specifies the output directory for PPD files.  The default
                output directory is "ppd".
           -l language(s)
                Specifies one or more languages to use when localizing the
                PPD file(s).  The default language is "en" (English).
                Separate multiple languages with commas, for example
                "de_DE,en_UK,es_ES,es_MX,es_US,fr_CA,fr_FR,it_IT" will
                create PPD files with German, UK English, Spanish (Spain,
                Mexico, and US), French (France and Canada), and Italian
                languages in each file.
           -m   Specifies that the output filename should be based on the
                ModelName value instead of FileName or PCFilenName.
           -t   Specifies that PPD files should be tested instead of
                generated.
           -v   Specifies verbose output, basically a running status of
                which files are being loaded or written.  -z Generates
                compressed PPD files (filename.ppd.gz).  The default is to
                generate uncompressed PPD files.
           --cr
           --crlf
           --lf Specifies the line ending to use - carriage return, carriage
                return and line feed, or line feed alone.  The default is to
                use the line feed character alone.
## NOTES         top
           PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a
           future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP
           can be supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).
