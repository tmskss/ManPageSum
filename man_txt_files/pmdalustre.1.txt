## NAME         top
           pmdalustre - lustre filesystem statistics performance metrics
           domain agent (PMDA)
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdalustre is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           reads and exports metric values from the statistics interfaces of
           a Lustre filesystem.
           pmdalustre searches for statistics interfaces from several
           locations, which vary depending on the version of Lustre
           installed locally.
           Recent Lustre versions (v2.12 and later) export statistics from
           the kernel debugfs pseudo filesystem, in the directories
           /sys/kernel/debug/lustre/llite and /sys/kernel/debug/lnet.  If
           these interfaces are not found during startup, pmdalustre will
           automatically check if the statistics interfaces are available
           from the procfs pseudo filesystem below the /proc/fs/lustre/llite
           and /proc/sys/lnet directories.  These are the default locations
           of the statistics for Lustre versions less than v2.12.
           If neither of the above filesystem interfaces are detected, or if
           the user wants to override the default locations, pmdalustre also
           supports an optional configuration file named
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/lustre.conf.  Note that $PCP_PMDAS_DIR is
           set to /var/lib/pcp/pmdas on most Linux based  systems.  The
           configuration file supports perl(1) variable assignment syntax.
           An example configuration file suitable for Lustre v2.12 and later
           is:
                        $LLITE_PATH="/sys/kernel/debug/lustre/llite/";
                        $LNET_PATH="/sys/kernel/debug/lustre/lnet/";
           See comments in the shipped lustre.conf file for further details.
           By default, this file is installed with everything commented (and
           so it has no effect unless edited) because the built-in
           heuristics used by pmdalustre should suffice.
           Finally, overriding all of the above, the LUSTRE_LLITE_PATH and
           LUSTRE_LNET_PATH environment variables may be set (and exported)
           to specify the directory locations of the statistics interfaces
           to be used.  This mechanism using environment variabes is
           intended to be used for development and testing purposes only.
           The pmdalustre process runs as the root user because debugfs
           directories are not normally readable by unprivileged users.
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install pmdalustre by using the Install script as the root user:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre
                # ./Install
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre
                # ./Remove
           pmdalustre is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/Install
               installation script for the pmdalustre agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdalustre agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/lustre.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdalustre
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/lustre.conf
               Configuration file for over-riding default statistics
               directories used by pmdalustre.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
