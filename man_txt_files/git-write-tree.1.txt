    GIT-WRITE-TREE(1)              Git Manual              GIT-WRITE-TREE(1)
## NAME         top
           git-write-tree - Create a tree object from the current index
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git write-tree [--missing-ok] [--prefix=<prefix>/]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Creates a tree object using the current index. The name of the
           new tree object is printed to standard output.
           The index must be in a fully merged state.
           Conceptually, git write-tree sync()s the current index contents
           into a set of tree files. In order to have that match what is
           actually in your directory right now, you need to have done a git
           update-index phase before you did the git write-tree.
## OPTIONS         top
           --missing-ok
               Normally git write-tree ensures that the objects referenced
               by the directory exist in the object database. This option
               disables this check.
           --prefix=<prefix>/
               Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory <prefix>.
               This can be used to write the tree object for a subproject
               that is in the named subdirectory.
