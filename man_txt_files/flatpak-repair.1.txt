## NAME         top
           flatpak-repair - Repair a flatpak installation
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak repair [OPTION...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Repair a flatpak installation by pruning and reinstalling invalid
           objects. The repair command does all of the following:
           •   Scan all locally available refs, removing any that don't
               correspond to a deployed ref.
           •   Verify each commit they point to, removing any invalid
               objects and noting any missing objects.
           •   Remove any refs that had an invalid object, and any
               non-partial refs that had missing objects.
           •   Prune all objects not referenced by a ref, which gets rid of
               any possibly invalid non-scanned objects.
           •   Enumerate all deployed refs and re-install any that are not
               in the repo (or are partial for a non-subdir deploy).
           Note that flatpak repair has to be run with root privileges to
           operate on the system installation.
           An alternative command for repairing OSTree repositories is
           ostree fsck.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           -u, --user
               Repair per-user installation.
           --system
               Repair system-wide installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Repair the system-wide installation specified by NAME among
               those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           --dry-run
               Only report inconsistencies, don't make any changes
           --reinstall-all
               Reinstall all refs, regardless of whether they were removed
               from the repo or not
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
