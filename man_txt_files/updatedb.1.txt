## NAME         top
           updatedb - update a file name database
## SYNOPSIS         top
           updatedb [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This manual page documents the GNU version of updatedb, which
           updates file name databases used by GNU locate.  The file name
           databases contain lists of files that were in particular
           directory trees when the databases were last updated.  The file
           name of the default database is determined when locate and
           updatedb are configured and installed.  The frequency with which
           the databases are updated and the directories for which they
           contain entries depend on how often updatedb is run, and with
           which arguments.
           In networked environments, it often makes sense to build a
           database at the root of each filesystem, containing the entries
           for that filesystem.  updatedb is then run for each filesystem on
           the fileserver where that filesystem is on a local disk, to
           prevent thrashing the network.  Users can select which databases
           locate searches using an environment variable or command line
           option; see locate(1).  Databases cannot be concatenated
           together.
           The LOCATGE02 database format was introduced in GNU findutils
           version 4.0 in order to allow machines with different byte
           orderings to share the databases.  GNU locate can read both the
           old and LOCATE02 database formats, though support for the old
           pre-4.0 database format will be removed shortly.
## OPTIONS         top
           --findoptions='-option1 -option2...'
                  Global options to pass on to find.  The environment
                  variable FINDOPTIONS also sets this value.  Default is
                  none.
           --localpaths='path1 path2...'
                  Non-network directories to put in the database.  Default
                  is /.
           --netpaths='path1 path2...'
                  Network (NFS, AFS, RFS, etc.) directories to put in the
                  database.  The environment variable NETPATHS also sets
                  this value.  Default is none.
           --prunepaths='path1 path2...'
                  Directories to not put in the database, which would
                  otherwise be.  Remove any trailing slashes from the path
                  names, otherwise updatedb won't recognise the paths you
                  want to omit (because it uses them as regular expression
                  patterns).  The environment variable PRUNEPATHS also sets
                  this value.  Default is /tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /afs.
           --prunefs='path...'
                  File systems to not put in the database, which would
                  otherwise be.  Note that files are pruned when a file
                  system is reached; any file system mounted under an
                  undesired file system will be ignored.  The environment
                  variable PRUNEFS also sets this value.  Default is nfs NFS
                  proc.
           --output=dbfile
                  The database file to build.  Default is system-dependent.
                  In Debian GNU/Linux, the default is
                  /var/cache/locate/locatedb.
           --localuser=user
                  The user to search non-network directories as, using
                  su(1).  Default is to search the non-network directories
                  as the current user.  You can also use the environment
                  variable LOCALUSER to set this user.
           --netuser=user
                  The user to search network directories as, using su(1).
                  Default is daemon.  You can also use the environment
                  variable NETUSER to set this user.
           --dbformat=F
                  Create the database in format F.  The default format is
                  called LOCATE02.  Alternatively the slocate format is also
                  supported.  When the slocate format is in use, the
                  database produced is marked as having security level 1.
                  If you want to build a system-wide slocate database, you
                  may want to run updatedb as root.
           --version
                  Print the version number of updatedb and exit.
           --help Print a summary of the options to updatedb and exit.
## BUGS         top
           The updatedb program correctly handles filenames containing
           newlines, but only if the system's sort command has a working -z
           option.  If you suspect that locate may need to return filenames
           containing newlines, consider using its --null option.
