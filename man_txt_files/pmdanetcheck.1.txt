## NAME         top
           pmdanetcheck - netcheck PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdanetcheck is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics
           Domain Agent (PMDA) which does basic network checks on the local
           host by using simple Python modules and, in some cases, external
           utilities such as ping(1).
           pmdanetcheck loads and acts as a bridge for any number of
           configured, separate PCP netcheck PMDA Python modules running
           Python code or external programs.  Existing Python modules and
           programs should be possible to be utilized with PCP netcheck PMDA
           modules with minimal effort.
           Note that on SELinux enabled systems for pmdanetcheck to be able
           to use the ping(1) command the pcp group must be able to create
           ICMP Echo sockets; please make sure the group id for pcp is
           included in the range at /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range and
           refer to icmp(7) for more details on this.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           pmdanetcheck reads a mandatory ini-style configuration file:
                  $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck/netcheck.conf
           This file must contain a [pmda] section.  The following PMDA
           options are available (their default values are shown in
           parenthesis), options marked with asterisk (*) can be overridden
           in module-specific configuration sections:
           modules (unset)
                  The pmdanetcheck PMDA reads module-specific configuration
                  for each module listed in the comma-separated list of
                  modules (mandatory).
           hosts (DGW,DNS) *
                  A comma-separated list of hosts (optional) specifies the
                  hosts to run the checks for.  The special values DGW, DNS,
                  NTP will be translated to the default gateway, nameservers
                  listed in /etc/resolv.conf, and timeservers listed in
                  /etc/chrony.conf, respectively, on PMDA startup.
           background_check (True) *
                  A boolean value for background_check (optional) controls
                  whether to run checks constantly in the background or only
                  on demand.  Refer to the default configuration file for
                  more discussion about this.
           check_hosts_parallel (True) *
                  check_hosts_parallel (optional) controls whether modules
                  should check hosts one by one or in parallel.
           check_interval (1m) *
                  check_interval (optional) specifies the time interval
                  between two consecutive checks for hosts when checks are
                  done in the background.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
                  complete description of the syntax for the time interval.
           align_interval (True) *
                  align_interval (optional) specifies whether to take the
                  previous check duration into account when pausing between
                  checks.
           module_failure_fatal (True)
                  A boolean value for module_failure_fatal (optional)
                  controls whether a module failing to initialize should
                  cause the whole PMDA to abort (this is the default) or to
                  start up with possibly remaining functional modules.
                  Module configuration errors and internal errors (such as
                  failing to register the provided PMNS metrics, see
                  pmns(5)) will always cause the PMDA to fail to start.
           For each module listed in modules a corresponding [module]
           section must be defined.  Each [module] section can contain at
           least the following options (their default values are shown in
           parenthesis):
           timeout (1)
                  Force a hard timeout (optional) for each individual
                  network check operation.
           debug (False)
                  Enable logging of internal debug messages (rarely used).
           The module-specific options modules accept are described in the
           default configuration file.
           Modules expect basic network functionality to be present on the
           system, for example the localhost address being reachable.
## INSTALLATION         top
           To install, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, the following must be done as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck
               # ./Remove
           pmdanetcheck is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
           In case module_failure_fatal is set to False, the PMDA
           installation will be considered successful if some (but not all)
           configured modules fail to load, in such cases metrics provided
           by the failing modules will not be available.  The pmdanetcheck
           agent log file (see below) will contain detailed information
           about activation of each module.
           Modules will provide real values only after having collected
           data.  For example, for the ping module the metric value is the
           exit value of the ping(1) command and for ping_latency the
           average packet latency as reported by ping(1).  For metrics
           indicating status, 0 denotes success.  In case a check has not
           finished yet its metric value is -1.  If a check was terminated
           during execution due to timeout the value is -2.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck/netcheck.conf
                configuration file for the pmdanetcheck agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck/netcheck/*.{py,python}
                PCP netcheck PMDA Python modules for the pmdanetcheck agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck/Install
                installation script for the pmdanetcheck agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck/Remove
                undo installation script for the pmdanetcheck agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/netcheck.log
                default log file for messages from the pmdanetcheck agent
           Note that the usual/default value for $PCP_PMDAS_DIR is
           /var/lib/pcp/pmdas and the default for $PCP_LOG_DIR is
           /var/log/pcp but these settings are platform dependent.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
