# sg(1) -- Linux manual page

    SG(1)                         User Commands                        SG(1)
## NAME         top
           sg - execute command as different group ID
## SYNOPSIS         top
           sg [-] [group [-c ] command]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The sg command works similar to newgrp but accepts a command. The
           command will be executed with the /bin/sh shell. With most shells
           you may run sg from, you need to enclose multi-word commands in
           quotes. Another difference between newgrp and sg is that some
           shells treat newgrp specially, replacing themselves with a new
           instance of a shell that newgrp creates. This doesn't happen with
           sg, so upon exit from a sg command you are returned to your
           previous group ID.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
           the behavior of this tool:
           SYSLOG_SG_ENAB (boolean)
               Enable "syslog" logging of sg activity.
## FILES         top
           /etc/passwd
               User account information.
           /etc/shadow
               Secure user account information.
           /etc/group
               Group account information.
           /etc/gshadow
               Secure group account information.

           id(1), login(1), newgrp(1), su(1), gpasswd(1), group(5),
