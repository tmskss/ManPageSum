## NAME         top
           fgconsole - print the number of the active VT.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           fgconsole [ -h --help | -V --version | -n --next-available ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           If the active Virtual Terminal is /dev/ttyN, then prints N on
           standard output.
           If the console is a serial console, then "serial" is printed
           instead.
           -h --help
                  Prints short usage message and exits.
           -V --version
                  Prints version number and exits.
           --next-available
                  Will show the next unallocated virtual terminal. Normally
                  6 virtual terminals are allocated, with number 7 used for
                  X; this will return "8" in this case.
## NOTES         top
           Under devfs, the consoles are in /dev/vc/N.  devfsd may maintain
           symlinks for compatibility.
