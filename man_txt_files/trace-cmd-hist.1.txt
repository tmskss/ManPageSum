## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-hist - show histogram of events in trace.dat file
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd hist [OPTIONS][input-file]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) hist displays a histogram form from the
           trace.dat file. Instead of showing the events as they were
           ordered, it creates a histogram that can be displayed per task or
           for all tasks where the most common events appear first. It uses
           the function tracer and call stacks that it finds to try to put
           together a call graph of the events.
## OPTIONS         top
           -i input-file
               By default, trace-cmd hist will read the file trace.dat. But
               the -i option open up the given input-file instead. Note, the
               input file may also be specified as the last item on the
               command line.
           -P
               To compact all events and show the call graphs by ignoring
               tasks and different PIDs, add the -P to do so. Instead of
               showing the task name, it will group all chains together and
               show "<all pids>".
