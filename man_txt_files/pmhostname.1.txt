    PMHOSTNAME(1)            General Commands Manual           PMHOSTNAME(1)
## NAME         top
           pmhostname - report hostname
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmhostname [-?]  [hostname]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmhostname reports the name of the host hostname as returned by
           gethostbyname(3).
           If hostname is not specified, then the local host name is
           retrieved using gethostname(2) and this is than passed to
           gethostbyname(3).
           pmhostname provides a service for shell scripts that mimics the
           logic formerly used by Performance Co-Pilot applications when
           trying to determine the official name of a host.  PCP
           applications no longer use DNS-based heuristics, and therefore
           this command is deprecated.
           If gethostbyname(3) fails, the input host name (either hostname
           or the result from calling gethostname(2)) is reported.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
## SEE ALSO         top
           nslookup(1), gethostname(2), gethostbyname(3), pcp.conf(5),
           pcp.env(5) and resolver(5).
