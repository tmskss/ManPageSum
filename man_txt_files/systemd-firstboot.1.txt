## NAME         top
           systemd-firstboot, systemd-firstboot.service - Initialize basic
           system settings on or before the first boot-up of a system
## SYNOPSIS         top
           systemd-firstboot [OPTIONS...]
           systemd-firstboot.service
## DESCRIPTION         top
           systemd-firstboot initializes basic system settings interactively
           during the first boot, or non-interactively on an offline system
           image. The service is started during boot if
           ConditionFirstBoot=yes is met, which essentially means that /etc/
           is empty, see systemd.unit(5) for details.
           The following settings may be configured:
           •   The machine ID of the system
           •   The system locale, more specifically the two locale variables
               LANG= and LC_MESSAGES
           •   The system keyboard map
           •   The system time zone
           •   The system hostname
           •   The kernel command line used when installing kernel images
           •   The root user's password and shell
           Each of the fields may either be queried interactively by users,
           set non-interactively on the tool's command line, or be copied
           from a host system that is used to set up the system image.
           If a setting is already initialized, it will not be overwritten
           and the user will not be prompted for the setting.
           Note that this tool operates directly on the file system and does
           not involve any running system services, unlike localectl(1),
           timedatectl(1) or hostnamectl(1). This allows systemd-firstboot
           to operate on mounted but not booted disk images and in early
           boot. It is not recommended to use systemd-firstboot on the
           running system after it has been set up.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           --root=root
               Takes a directory path as an argument. All paths will be
               prefixed with the given alternate root path, including config
               search paths. This is useful to operate on a system image
               mounted to the specified directory instead of the host system
               itself.
           --image=path
               Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If
               specified all operations are applied to file system in the
               indicated disk image. This is similar to --root= but operates
               on file systems stored in disk images or block devices. The
               disk image should either contain just a file system or a set
               of file systems within a GPT partition table, following the
               Discoverable Partitions Specification[1]. For further
               information on supported disk images, see systemd-nspawn(1)'s
               switch of the same name.
           --locale=LOCALE, --locale-messages=LOCALE
               Sets the system locale, more specifically the LANG= and
               LC_MESSAGES settings. The argument should be a valid locale
               identifier, such as "de_DE.UTF-8". This controls the
               locale.conf(5) configuration file.
           --keymap=KEYMAP
               Sets the system keyboard layout. The argument should be a
               valid keyboard map, such as "de-latin1". This controls the
               "KEYMAP" entry in the vconsole.conf(5) configuration file.
           --timezone=TIMEZONE
               Sets the system time zone. The argument should be a valid
               time zone identifier, such as "Europe/Berlin". This controls
               the localtime(5) symlink.
           --hostname=HOSTNAME
               Sets the system hostname. The argument should be a hostname,
               compatible with DNS. This controls the hostname(5)
               configuration file.
           --setup-machine-id
               Initialize the system's machine ID to a random ID. This
               controls the machine-id(5) file.
               This option only works in combination with --root= or
               --image=. On a running system, machine-id is written by the
               manager with help from systemd-machine-id-commit.service(8).
           --machine-id=ID
               Set the system's machine ID to the specified value. The same
               restrictions apply as to --setup-machine-id.
           --root-password=PASSWORD, --root-password-file=PATH,
           --root-password-hashed=HASHED_PASSWORD
               Sets the password of the system's root user. This
               creates/modifies the passwd(5) and shadow(5) files. This
               setting exists in three forms: --root-password= accepts the
               password to set directly on the command line,
               --root-password-file= reads it from a file and
               --root-password-hashed= accepts an already hashed password on
               the command line. See shadow(5) for more information on the
               format of the hashed password. Note that it is not
               recommended to specify plaintext passwords on the command
               line, as other users might be able to see them simply by
               invoking ps(1).
           --root-shell=SHELL
               Sets the shell of the system's root user. This
               creates/modifies the passwd(5) file.
           --kernel-command-line=CMDLINE
               Sets the system's kernel command line. This controls the
               /etc/kernel/cmdline file which is used by kernel-install(8).
           --prompt-locale, --prompt-keymap, --prompt-timezone,
           --prompt-hostname, --prompt-root-password, --prompt-root-shell
               Prompt the user interactively for a specific basic setting.
               Note that any explicit configuration settings specified on
               the command line take precedence, and the user is not
               prompted for it.
           --prompt
               Query the user for locale, keymap, timezone, hostname, root's
               password, and root's shell. This is equivalent to specifying
               --prompt-locale, --prompt-keymap, --prompt-timezone,
               --prompt-hostname, --prompt-root-password,
               --prompt-root-shell in combination.
           --copy-locale, --copy-keymap, --copy-timezone,
           --copy-root-password, --copy-root-shell
               Copy a specific basic setting from the host. This only works
               in combination with --root= or --image=.
           --copy
               Copy locale, keymap, time zone, root password and shell from
               the host. This is equivalent to specifying --copy-locale,
               --copy-keymap, --copy-timezone, --copy-root-password,
               --copy-root-shell in combination.
           --force
               Write configuration even if the relevant files already exist.
               Without this option, systemd-firstboot doesn't modify or
               replace existing files. Note that when configuring the root
               account, even with this option, systemd-firstboot only
               modifies the entry of the "root" user, leaving other entries
               in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow intact.
           --reset
               If specified, all existing files that are configured by
               systemd-firstboot are removed. Note that the files are
               removed regardless of whether they'll be configured with a
               new value or not. This operation ensures that the next boot
               of the image will be considered a first boot, and
               systemd-firstboot will prompt again to configure each of the
               removed files.
           --delete-root-password
               Removes the password of the system's root user, enabling
               login as root without a password unless the root account is
               locked. Note that this is extremely insecure and hence this
               option should not be used lightly.
           --welcome=
               Takes a boolean argument. By default when prompting the user
               for configuration options a brief welcome text is shown
               before the first question is asked. Pass false to this option
               to turn off the welcome text.
           -h, --help
               Print a short help text and exit.
           --version
               Print a short version string and exit.
## CREDENTIALS         top
           systemd-firstboot supports the service credentials logic as
           implemented by ImportCredential=/LoadCredential=/SetCredential=
           (see systemd.exec(1) for details). The following credentials are
           used when passed in:
           "passwd.hashed-password.root", "passwd.plaintext-password.root"
               A hashed or plaintext version of the root password to use, in
               place of prompting the user. These credentials are equivalent
               to the same ones defined for the systemd-sysusers.service(8)
               service.
           "passwd.shell.root"
               Specifies the shell binary to use for the specified account.
               Equivalent to the credential of the same name defined for the
               systemd-sysusers.service(8) service.
           "firstboot.locale", "firstboot.locale-messages"
               These credentials specify the locale settings to set during
               first boot, in place of prompting the user.
           "firstboot.keymap"
               This credential specifies the keyboard setting to set during
               first boot, in place of prompting the user.
               Note the relationship to the "vconsole.keymap" credential
               understood by systemd-vconsole-setup.service(8): both
               ultimately affect the same setting, but firstboot.keymap is
               written into /etc/vconsole.conf on first boot (if not already
               configured), and then read from there by
               systemd-vconsole-setup, while vconsole.keymap is read on
               every boot, and is not persisted to disk (but any
               configuration in vconsole.conf will take precedence if
               present).
           "firstboot.timezone"
               This credential specifies the system timezone setting to set
               during first boot, in place of prompting the user.
           Note that by default the systemd-firstboot.service unit file is
           set up to inherit the listed credentials from the service
           manager. Thus, when invoking a container with an unpopulated
           /etc/ for the first time it is possible to configure the root
           user's password to be "systemd" like this:
               # systemd-nspawn --image=... --set-credential=firstboot.locale:de_DE.UTF-8 ...
           Note that these credentials are only read and applied during the
           first boot process. Once they are applied they remain applied for
           subsequent boots, and the credentials are not considered anymore.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
## KERNEL COMMAND LINE         top
           systemd.firstboot=
               Takes a boolean argument, defaults to on. If off,
               systemd-firstboot.service won't interactively query the user
               for basic settings at first boot, even if those settings are
               not initialized yet.
