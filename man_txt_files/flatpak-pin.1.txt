    FLATPAK PIN(1)                 flatpak pin                FLATPAK PIN(1)
## NAME         top
           flatpak-pin - Pin runtimes to prevent automatic removal
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak pin [OPTION...] PATTERN...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Flatpak maintains a list of patterns that define which refs are
           pinned. A pinned ref will never be automatically uninstalled (as
           are unused runtimes periodically). This can be useful if for
           example you are using a runtime for development purposes.
           Runtimes that are explicitly installed, rather than installed as
           a dependency of something else, are automatically pinned.
           The patterns are just a partial ref, with the * character
           matching anything within that part of the ref. Only runtimes can
           be pinned, not apps. Here are some example patterns:
               org.some.Runtime
               org.some.Runtime//unstable
               runtime/org.domain.*
               org.some.Runtime/arm
           To list the current set of pins, run this command without any
           patterns.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           --remove
               Instead of adding the patterns, remove matching patterns.
           -u, --user
               Pin refs in a per-user installation.
           --system
               Pin refs in the default system-wide installation.
           --installation=NAME
               Pin refs in a system-wide installation specified by NAME
               among those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
               --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
## EXAMPLES         top
           $ flatpak pin
           $ flatpak pin org.freedesktop.Platform//19.08
           $ flatpak pin --remove org.freedesktop.Platform//19.08
