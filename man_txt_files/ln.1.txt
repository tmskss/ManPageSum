## NAME         top
           ln - make links between files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME
           ln [OPTION]... TARGET
           ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY
           ln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           In the 1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.
           In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current
           directory.  In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET
           in DIRECTORY.  Create hard links by default, symbolic links with
           --symbolic.  By default, each destination (name of new link)
           should not already exist.  When creating hard links, each TARGET
           must exist.  Symbolic links can hold arbitrary text; if later
           resolved, a relative link is interpreted in relation to its
           parent directory.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           --backup[=CONTROL]
                  make a backup of each existing destination file
           -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument
           -d, -F, --directory
                  allow the superuser to attempt to hard link directories
                  (note: will probably fail due to system restrictions, even
                  for the superuser)
           -f, --force
                  remove existing destination files
           -i, --interactive
                  prompt whether to remove destinations
           -L, --logical
                  dereference TARGETs that are symbolic links
           -n, --no-dereference
                  treat LINK_NAME as a normal file if it is a symbolic link
                  to a directory
           -P, --physical
                  make hard links directly to symbolic links
           -r, --relative
                  with -s, create links relative to link location
           -s, --symbolic
                  make symbolic links instead of hard links
           -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
                  override the usual backup suffix
           -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
                  specify the DIRECTORY in which to create the links
           -T, --no-target-directory
                  treat LINK_NAME as a normal file always
           -v, --verbose
                  print name of each linked file
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or
           SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected
           via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL
           environment variable.  Here are the values:
           none, off
                  never make backups (even if --backup is given)
           numbered, t
                  make numbered backups
           existing, nil
                  numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
           simple, never
                  always make simple backups
           Using -s ignores -L and -P.  Otherwise, the last option specified
           controls behavior when a TARGET is a symbolic link, defaulting to
           -P.
