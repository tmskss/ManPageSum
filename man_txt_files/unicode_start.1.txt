## NAME         top
           unicode_start - put keyboard and console in unicode mode
## SYNOPSIS         top
           unicode_start [font [umap]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The unicode_start command will put the keyboard and console into
           Unicode (UTF-8) mode.
           For the keyboard this means that one can attach 16-bit U+xxxx
           values to keyboard keys using loadkeys(1), and have these appear
           as UTF-8 input to user programs.  Also, that one can type
           hexadecimal Alt-xxxx using the numeric keypad, and again produce
           UTF-8.
           For the console this means that the kernel expects UTF-8 output
           from user programs, and displays the output accordingly.
           The parameter font is a font that is loaded. It should have a
           built-in Unicode map, or, if it hasn't, such a map can be given
           explicitly as second parameter.  When no font was specified, the
           current font is kept.
## NOTE         top
           Unicode mode is a parameter with a value per virtual console.
           However, usually the font and keymap is common to all consoles.
