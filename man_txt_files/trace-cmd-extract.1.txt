## NAME         top
           trace-cmd-extract - extract out the data from the Ftrace Linux
           tracer.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           trace-cmd extract [OPTIONS]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The trace-cmd(1) extract is usually used after trace-cmd-start(1)
           and trace-cmd-stop(1). It can be used after the Ftrace tracer has
           been started manually through the Ftrace pseudo file system.
           The extract command creates a trace.dat file that can be used by
           trace-cmd-report(1) to read from. It reads the kernel internal
           ring buffer to produce the trace.dat file.
## OPTIONS         top
           -p plugin
               Although extract does not start any traces, some of the
               plugins require just reading the output in ASCII format.
               These are the latency tracers, since the latency tracers have
               a separate internal buffer. The plugin option is therefore
               only necessary for the wakeup, wakeup-rt, irqsoff, preemptoff
               and preemptirqsoff plugins.
                   With out this option, the extract command will extract from the internal
                   Ftrace buffers.
           -O option
               If a latency tracer is being extracted, and the -p option is
               used, then there are some Ftrace options that can change the
               format. This will update those options before extracting. To
               see the list of options see trace-cmd-list. To enable an
               option, write its name, to disable the option append the
               characters no to it. For example: noprint-parent will disable
               the print-parent option that prints the parent function in
               printing a function event.
           -o outputfile
               By default, the extract command will create a trace.dat file.
               This option will change where the file is written to.
           -s
               Extract from the snapshot buffer (if the kernel supports it).
           --date
               This is the same as the trace-cmd-record(1) --date option,
               but it does cause the extract routine to disable all tracing.
               That is, the end of the extract will perform something
               similar to trace-cmd-reset(1).
           -B buffer-name
               If the kernel supports multiple buffers, this will extract
               the trace for only the given buffer. It does not affect any
               other buffer. This may be used multiple times to specify
               different buffers. When this option is used, the top level
               instance will not be extracted unless -t is given.
           -a
               Extract all existing buffer instances. When this option is
               used, the top level instance will not be extracted unless -t
               is given.
           -t
               Extracts the top level instance buffer. Without the -B or -a
               option this is the same as the default. But if -B or -a is
               used, this is required if the top level instance buffer
               should also be extracted.
           --verbose[=level]
               Set the log level. Supported log levels are "none",
               "critical", "error", "warning", "info", "debug", "all" or
               their identifiers "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6". Setting
               the log level to specific value enables all logs from that
               and all previous levels. The level will default to "info" if
               one is not specified.
                   Example: enable all critical, error and warning logs
                   trace-cmd extract --verbose=warning
