    rsync-ssl(1)                  User Commands                 rsync-ssl(1)
## NAME         top
           rsync-ssl - a helper script for connecting to an ssl rsync daemon
## SYNOPSIS         top
           rsync-ssl [--type=SSL_TYPE] RSYNC_ARGS
           The online version of this manpage (that includes cross-linking
           of topics) is available at
           https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync-ssl.1.
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The rsync-ssl script helps you to run an rsync copy to/from an
           rsync daemon that requires ssl connections.
           The script requires that you specify an rsync-daemon arg in the
           style of either hostname:: (with 2 colons) or rsync://hostname/.
           The default port used for connecting is 874 (one higher than the
           normal 873) unless overridden in the environment.  You can
           specify an overriding port via --port or by including it in the
           normal spot in the URL format, though both of those require your
           rsync version to be at least 3.2.0.
## OPTIONS         top
           If the first arg is a --type=SSL_TYPE option, the script will
           only use that particular program to open an ssl connection
           instead of trying to find an openssl or stunnel executable via a
           simple heuristic (assuming that the RSYNC_SSL_TYPE environment
           variable is not set as well -- see below).  This option must
           specify one of openssl or stunnel.  The equal sign is required
           for this particular option.
           All the other options are passed through to the rsync command, so
           consult the rsync(1) manpage for more information on how it
           works.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The ssl helper scripts are affected by the following environment
           variables:
           RSYNC_SSL_TYPE
                  Specifies the program type that should be used to open the
                  ssl connection.  It must be one of openssl or stunnel.
                  The --type=SSL_TYPE option overrides this, when specified.
           RSYNC_SSL_PORT
                  If specified, the value is the port number that is used as
                  the default when the user does not specify a port in their
                  rsync command.  When not specified, the default port
                  number is 874.  (Note that older rsync versions (prior to
                  3.2.0) did not communicate an overriding port number value
                  to the helper script.)
           RSYNC_SSL_CERT
                  If specified, the value is a filename that contains a
                  certificate to use for the connection.
           RSYNC_SSL_KEY
                  If specified, the value is a filename that contains a key
                  for the provided certificate to use for the connection.
           RSYNC_SSL_CA_CERT
                  If specified, the value is a filename that contains a
                  certificate authority certificate that is used to validate
                  the connection.
           RSYNC_SSL_OPENSSL
                  Specifies the openssl executable to run when the
                  connection type is set to openssl.  If unspecified, the
                  $PATH is searched for "openssl".
           RSYNC_SSL_GNUTLS
                  Specifies the gnutls-cli executable to run when the
                  connection type is set to gnutls.  If unspecified, the
                  $PATH is searched for "gnutls-cli".
           RSYNC_SSL_STUNNEL
                  Specifies the stunnel executable to run when the
                  connection type is set to stunnel.  If unspecified, the
                  $PATH is searched first for "stunnel4" and then for
                  "stunnel".
## EXAMPLES         top
               rsync-ssl -aiv example.com::mod/ dest
               rsync-ssl --type=openssl -aiv example.com::mod/ dest
               rsync-ssl -aiv --port 9874 example.com::mod/ dest
               rsync-ssl -aiv rsync://example.com:9874/mod/ dest
## THE SERVER SIDE         top
           For help setting up an SSL/TLS supporting rsync, see the
           instructions in rsyncd.conf.

## CAVEATS         top
           Note that using an stunnel connection requires at least version 4
           of stunnel, which should be the case on modern systems.  Also, it
           does not verify a connection against the CA certificate
           collection, so it only encrypts the connection without any cert
           validation unless you have specified the certificate environment
           options.
           This script also supports a --type=gnutls option, but at the time
           of this release the gnutls-cli command was dropping output,
           making it unusable.  If that bug has been fixed in your version,
           feel free to put gnutls into an exported RSYNC_SSL_TYPE
           environment variable to make its use the default.
