## NAME         top
           dpkg-query - a tool to query the dpkg database
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dpkg-query [option...] command
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dpkg-query is a tool to show information about packages listed in
           the dpkg database.
## COMMANDS         top
           -l, --list [package-name-pattern...]
               List all known packages matching one or more patterns,
               regardless of their status, which includes any real or
               virtual package referenced in any dependency relationship
               field (such as Breaks, Enhances, etc.).  If no package-name-
               pattern is given, list all packages in
               /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/status, excluding the ones marked as
               not-installed (i.e.  those which have been previously
               purged).  Normal shell wildcard characters are allowed in
               package-name-pattern.  Please note you will probably have to
               quote package-name-pattern to prevent the shell from
               performing filename expansion.  For example this will list
               all package names starting with “libc6”:
                dpkg-query -l 'libc6*'
               The first three columns of the output show the desired
               action, the package status, and errors, in that order.
               Desired action:
               u = Unknown
               i = Install
               h = Hold
               r = Remove
               p = Purge
               Package status:
               n = Not-installed
               c = Config-files
               H = Half-installed
               U = Unpacked
               F = Half-configured
               W = Triggers-awaiting
               t = Triggers-pending
               i = Installed
               Error flags:
               <empty> = (none)
               R = Reinst-required
               An uppercase status or error letter indicates the package is
               likely to cause severe problems. Please refer to dpkg(1) for
               information about the above states and flags.
               The output format of this option is not configurable, but
               varies automatically to fit the terminal width. It is
               intended for human readers, and is not easily machine-
               readable. See -W (--show) and --showformat for a way to
               configure the output format.
           -W, --show [package-name-pattern...]
               Just like the --list option this will list all packages
               matching the given patterns. However the output can be
               customized using the --showformat option.
               The default output format gives one line per matching
               package, each line consisting of the package name and its
               installed version, separated by a tab.  The package name will
               be architecture qualified for packages with a Multi-Arch
               field with the value same or with a foreign architecture,
               which is an architecture that is neither the native one nor
               all.
           -s, --status [package-name...]
               Report status of specified packages. This just displays the
               entry in the installed package status database.  If no
               package-name is specified it will display all package entries
               in the status database (since dpkg 1.19.1).  When multiple
               package-name entries are listed, the requested status entries
               are separated by an empty line, with the same order as
               specified on the argument list.
           -L, --listfiles package-name...
               List files installed to your system from package-name. When
               multiple package-names are listed, the requested lists of
               files are separated by an empty line, with the same order as
               specified on the argument list.
               Each file diversion is printed on its own line after its
               diverted file, prefixed with one of the following localized
               strings:
                 locally diverted to: diverted-to
                 package diverts others to: diverted-to
                 diverted by pkg to: diverted-to
               Hint: When machine parsing the output, it is customary to set
               the locale to C.UTF-8 to get reproducible results. On some
               systems this might also require adapting the LANGUAGE
               environment variable appropriately if it is already set (see
               locale(7)).
               This command will not list extra files created by maintainer
               scripts, nor will it list alternatives.
           --control-list package-name
               List control files installed to your system from package-name
               (since dpkg 1.16.5).  These can be used as input arguments to
               --control-show.
           --control-show package-name control-file
               Print the control-file installed to your system from package-
               name to the standard output (since dpkg 1.16.5).
           -c, --control-path package-name [control-file]
               List paths for control files installed to your system from
               package-name (since dpkg 1.15.4).  If control-file is
               specified then only list the path for that control file if it
               is present.
               Warning: this command is deprecated as it gives direct access
               to the internal dpkg database, please switch to use
               --control-list and --control-show instead for all cases where
               those commands might give the same end result. Although, as
               long as there is still at least one case where this command
               is needed (i.e. when having to remove a damaging postrm
               maintainer script), and while there is no good solution for
               that, this command will not get removed.
           -S, --search filename-search-pattern...
               Search for packages that own files corresponding to the given
               patterns.  Standard shell wildcard characters can be used in
               the pattern, where asterisk (*) and question mark (?) will
               match a slash, and backslash (\) will be used as an escape
               character.
               If the first character in the filename-search-pattern is none
               of ‘*[?/’ then it will be considered a substring match and
               will be implicitly surrounded by ‘*’ (as in *filename-search-
               pattern*).  If the subsequent string contains any of ‘*[?\’,
               then it will handled like a glob pattern, otherwise any
               trailing ‘/’ or ‘/.’ will be removed and a literal path
               lookup will be performed.
               This command will not list extra files created by maintainer
               scripts, nor will it list alternatives.
               The output format consists of one line per matching pattern,
               with a list of packages owning the pathname separated by a
               comma (U+002C ‘,’) and a space (U+0020 ‘ ’), followed by a
               colon (U+003A ‘:’) and a space, followed by the pathname. As
               in:
                 pkgname1, pkgname2: pathname1
                 pkgname3: pathname2
               File diversions are printed with the following localized
               strings:
                 diversion by pkgname from: diverted-from
                 diversion by pkgname to: diverted-to
               or for local diversions:
                 local diversion from: diverted-from
                 local diversion to: diverted-to
               Hint: When machine parsing the output, it is customary to set
               the locale to C.UTF-8 to get reproducible results.
           -p, --print-avail [package-name...]
               Display details about packages, as found in
               /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/available.  If no package-name is
               specified, it will display all package entries in the
               available database (since dpkg 1.19.1).  When multiple
               package-name are listed, the requested available entries are
               separated by an empty line, with the same order as specified
               on the argument list.
               Users of APT-based frontends should use apt show package-name
               instead as the available file is only kept up-to-date when
               using dselect.
           -?, --help
               Show the usage message and exit.
           --version
               Show the version and exit.
## OPTIONS         top
           --admindir=dir
               Change the location of the dpkg database. The default
               location is /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg.
           --root=directory
               Set the root directory to directory, which sets the
               administrative directory to
               «directory/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» (since dpkg 1.21.0).
           --load-avail
               Also load the available file when using the --show and --list
               commands, which now default to only querying the status file
               (since dpkg 1.16.2).
           --no-pager
               Disables the use of any pager when showing information (since
               dpkg 1.19.2).
           -f, --showformat=format
               This option is used to specify the format of the output
               --show will produce (short option since dpkg 1.13.1).  The
               format is a string that will be output for each package
               listed.
               In the format string, “\” introduces escapes:
               \n newline
               \r carriage return
               \t tab
               “\” before any other character suppresses any special meaning
               of the following character, which is useful for “\” and “$”.
               Package information can be included by inserting variable
               references to package fields using the syntax
               “${field[;width]}”. Fields are printed right-aligned unless
               the width is negative in which case left alignment will be
               used. The following fields are recognized but they are not
               necessarily available in the status file (only internal
               fields or fields stored in the binary package end up in it):

               Version
               The following are virtual fields, generated by dpkg-query
               from values from other fields (note that these do not use
               valid names for fields in control files):
               binary:Package
                   It contains the binary package name with a possible
                   architecture qualifier like “libc6:amd64” (since dpkg
                   1.16.2).  An architecture qualifier will be present to
                   make the package name unambiguous, for packages with a
                   Multi-Arch field with the value same or with a foreign
                   architecture, which is an architecture that is neither
                   the native one nor all.
               binary:Synopsis
                   It contains the package short description (since dpkg
                   1.19.1).
               binary:Summary
                   This is an alias for binary:Synopsis (since dpkg 1.16.2).
               db:Status-Abbrev
                   It contains the abbreviated package status (as three
                   characters), such as “ii ” or “iHR” (since dpkg 1.16.2).
                   See the --list command description for more details.
               db:Status-Want
                   It contains the package wanted status, part of the Status
                   field (since dpkg 1.17.11).
               db:Status-Status
                   It contains the package status word, part of the Status
                   field (since dpkg 1.17.11).
               db:Status-Eflag
                   It contains the package status error flag, part of the
                   Status field (since dpkg 1.17.11).
               db-fsys:Files
                   It contains the list of the package filesystem entries
                   separated by newlines (since dpkg 1.19.3).
               db-fsys:Last-Modified
                   It contains the timestamp in seconds of the last time the
                   package filesystem entries were modified (since dpkg
                   1.19.3).
               source:Package
                   It contains the source package name for this binary
                   package (since dpkg 1.16.2).
               source:Version
                   It contains the source package version for this binary
                   package (since dpkg 1.16.2)
               source:Upstream-Version
                   It contains the source package upstream version for this
                   binary package (since dpkg 1.18.16)
               The default format string is
               “${binary:Package}\t${Version}\n”.  Actually, all other
               fields found in the status file (i.e. user defined fields)
               can be requested, too. They will be printed as-is, though, no
               conversion nor error checking is done on them. To get the
               name of the dpkg maintainer and the installed version, you
               could run:
                dpkg-query -f='${binary:Package} ${Version}\t${Maintainer}\n' \
                 -W dpkg
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0   The requested query was successfully performed.
           1   The requested query failed either fully or partially, due to
               no file or package being found (except for --control-path,
               --control-list and --control-show were such errors are
               fatal).
           2   Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
               usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to
               the database, memory allocations, etc.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
       External environment
           SHELL
               Sets the program to execute when spawning a command via a
               shell (since dpkg 1.19.2).
           PAGER
           DPKG_PAGER
               Sets the pager command to use (since dpkg 1.19.1), which will
               be executed with «$SHELL -c».  If SHELL is not set, «sh» will
               be used instead.  The DPKG_PAGER overrides the PAGER
               environment variable (since dpkg 1.19.2).
           DPKG_ROOT
               If set and the --root option has not been specified, it will
               be used as the filesystem root directory (since dpkg 1.21.0).
           DPKG_ADMINDIR
               If set and the --admindir option has not been specified, it
               will be used as the dpkg data directory.
           DPKG_DEBUG
               Sets the debug mask (since dpkg 1.21.10) from an octal value.
               The currently accepted flags are described in the dpkg
               --debug option, but not all these flags might have an effect
               on this program.
           DPKG_COLORS
               Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
               accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.
       Internal environment
           LESS
               Defined by dpkg-query to “-FRSXMQ”, if not already set, when
               spawning a pager (since dpkg 1.19.2).  To change the default
               behavior, this variable can be preset to some other value
               including an empty string, or the PAGER or DPKG_PAGER
               variables can be set to disable specific options with «-+»,
               for example DPKG_PAGER="less -+F".
## SECURITY         top
           Query operations should never require root, and delegating their
           execution to unprivileged users via some gain-root command can
           have security implications (such as privilege escalation), for
