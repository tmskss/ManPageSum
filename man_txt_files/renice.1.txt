    RENICE(1)                     User Commands                    RENICE(1)
## NAME         top
           renice - alter priority of running processes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           renice [--priority|--relative] priority [-g|-p|-u] identifier...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           renice alters the scheduling priority of one or more running
           processes. The first argument is the priority value to be used.
           The other arguments are interpreted as process IDs (by default),
           process group IDs, user IDs, or user names. renice'ing a process
           group causes all processes in the process group to have their
           scheduling priority altered. renice'ing a user causes all
           processes owned by the user to have their scheduling priority
           altered.
           If no -n, --priority or --relative option is used, then the
           priority is set as absolute.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n priority
               Specify the absolute or relative (depending on environment
               variable POSIXLY_CORRECT) scheduling priority to be used for
               the process, process group, or user. Use of the option -n is
               optional, but when used, it must be the first argument. See
               NOTES for more information.
           --priority priority
               Specify an absolute scheduling priority. Priority is set to
               the given value. This is the default, when no option is
               specified.
           --relative priority
               Specify a relative scheduling priority. Same as the standard
               POSIX -n option. Priority gets incremented/decremented by the
               given value.
           -g, --pgrp
               Interpret the succeeding arguments as process group IDs.
           -p, --pid
               Interpret the succeeding arguments as process IDs (the
               default).
           -u, --user
               Interpret the succeeding arguments as usernames or UIDs.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## FILES         top
           /etc/passwd
               to map user names to user IDs
## NOTES         top
           Users other than the superuser may only alter the priority of
           processes they own. Furthermore, an unprivileged user can only
           increase the "nice value" (i.e., choose a lower priority) and
           such changes are irreversible unless (since Linux 2.6.12) the
           user has a suitable "nice" resource limit (see ulimit(1p) and
           getrlimit(2)).
           The superuser may alter the priority of any process and set the
           priority to any value in the range -20 to 19. Useful priorities
           are: 19 (the affected processes will run only when nothing else
           in the system wants to), 0 (the "base" scheduling priority),
           anything negative (to make things go very fast).
           For historical reasons in this implementation, the -n option did
           not follow the POSIX specification. Therefore, instead of setting
           a relative priority, it sets an absolute priority by default. As
           this may not be desirable, this behavior can be controlled by
           setting the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT to be fully
           POSIX compliant. See the -n option for details. See --relative
           and --priority for options that do not change behavior depending
           on environment variables.
## HISTORY         top
           The renice command appeared in 4.0BSD.
## EXAMPLES         top
           The following command would change the priority of the processes
           with PIDs 987 and 32, plus all processes owned by the users
           daemon and root:
           renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32
