    ECHO(1)                       User Commands                      ECHO(1)
## NAME         top
           echo - display a line of text
## SYNOPSIS         top
           echo [SHORT-OPTION]... [STRING]...
           echo LONG-OPTION
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Echo the STRING(s) to standard output.
           -n     do not output the trailing newline
           -e     enable interpretation of backslash escapes
           -E     disable interpretation of backslash escapes (default)
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           If -e is in effect, the following sequences are recognized:
           \\     backslash
           \a     alert (BEL)
           \b     backspace
           \c     produce no further output
           \e     escape
           \f     form feed
           \n     new line
           \r     carriage return
           \t     horizontal tab
           \v     vertical tab
           \0NNN  byte with octal value NNN (1 to 3 digits)
           \xHH   byte with hexadecimal value HH (1 to 2 digits)
           NOTE: your shell may have its own version of echo, which usually
           supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your
           shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
           NOTE: printf(1) is a preferred alternative, which does not have
           issues outputting option-like strings.
