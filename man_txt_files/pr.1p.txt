## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           pr — print files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pr [+page] [-column] [-adFmrt] [-e[char][gap]] [-h header] [-i[char][gap]]
               [-l lines] [-n[char][width]] [-o offset] [-s[char]] [-w width] [-fp]
               [file...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The pr utility is a printing and pagination filter. If multiple
           input files are specified, each shall be read, formatted, and
           written to standard output. By default, the input shall be
           separated into 66-line pages, each with:
            *  A 5-line header that includes the page number, date, time,
               and the pathname of the file
            *  A 5-line trailer consisting of blank lines
           If standard output is associated with a terminal, diagnostic
           messages shall be deferred until the pr utility has completed
           processing.
           When options specifying multi-column output are specified, output
           text columns shall be of equal width; input lines that do not fit
           into a text column shall be truncated. By default, text columns
           shall be separated with at least one <blank>.
## OPTIONS         top
           The pr utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
           that: the page option has a '+' delimiter; page and column can be
           multi-digit numbers; some of the option-arguments are optional;
           and some of the option-arguments cannot be specified as separate
           arguments from the preceding option letter. In particular, the -s
           option does not allow the option letter to be separated from its
           argument, and the options -e, -i, and -n require that both
           arguments, if present, not be separated from the option letter.
           The following options shall be supported. In the following option
           descriptions, column, lines, offset, page, and width are positive
           decimal integers; gap is a non-negative decimal integer.
           +page     Begin output at page number page of the formatted
                     input.
           -column   Produce multi-column output that is arranged in column
                     columns (the default shall be 1) and is written down
                     each column in the order in which the text is received
                     from the input file. This option should not be used
                     with -m.  The options -e and -i shall be assumed for
                     multiple text-column output. Whether or not text
                     columns are produced with identical vertical lengths is
                     unspecified, but a text column shall never exceed the
                     length of the page (see the -l option). When used with
                     -t, use the minimum number of lines to write the
                     output.
           -a        Modify the effect of the -column option so that the
                     columns are filled across the page in a round-robin
                     order (for example, when column is 2, the first input
                     line heads column 1, the second heads column 2, the
                     third is the second line in column 1, and so on).
           -d        Produce output that is double-spaced; append an extra
                     <newline> following every <newline> found in the input.
           -e[char][gap]
                     Expand each input <tab> to the next greater column
                     position specified by the formula n*gap+1, where n is
                     an integer > 0. If gap is zero or is omitted, it shall
                     default to 8. All <tab> characters in the input shall
                     be expanded into the appropriate number of <space>
                     characters. If any non-digit character, char, is
                     specified, it shall be used as the input <tab>.  If the
                     first character of the -e option-argument is a digit,
                     the entire option-argument shall be assumed to be gap.
           -f        Use a <form-feed> for new pages, instead of the default
                     behavior that uses a sequence of <newline> characters.
                     Pause before beginning the first page if the standard
                     output is associated with a terminal.
           -F        Use a <form-feed> for new pages, instead of the default
                     behavior that uses a sequence of <newline> characters.
           -h header Use the string header to replace the contents of the
                     file operand in the page header.
           -i[char][gap]
                     In output, replace <space> characters with <tab>
                     characters wherever one or more adjacent <space>
                     characters reach column positions gap+1, 2* gap+1, 3*
                     gap+1, and so on. If gap is zero or is omitted, default
                     tab settings at every eighth column position shall be
                     assumed. If any non-digit character, char, is
                     specified, it shall be used as the output <tab>.  If
                     the first character of the -i option-argument is a
                     digit, the entire option-argument shall be assumed to
                     be gap.
           -l lines  Override the 66-line default and reset the page length
                     to lines.  If lines is not greater than the sum of both
                     the header and trailer depths (in lines), the pr
                     utility shall suppress both the header and trailer, as
                     if the -t option were in effect.
           -m        Merge files. Standard output shall be formatted so the
                     pr utility writes one line from each file specified by
                     a file operand, side by side into text columns of equal
                     fixed widths, in terms of the number of column
                     positions. Implementations shall support merging of at
                     least nine file operands.
           -n[char][width]
                     Provide width-digit line numbering (default for width
                     shall be 5). The number shall occupy the first width
                     column positions of each text column of default output
                     or each line of -m output. If char (any non-digit
                     character) is given, it shall be appended to the line
                     number to separate it from whatever follows (default
                     for char is a <tab>).
           -o offset Each line of output shall be preceded by offset <space>
                     characters. If the -o option is not specified, the
                     default offset shall be zero. The space taken is in
                     addition to the output line width (see the -w option
                     below).
           -p        Pause before beginning each page if the standard output
                     is directed to a terminal (pr shall write an <alert> to
                     standard error and wait for a <carriage-return> to be
                     read on /dev/tty).
           -r        Write no diagnostic reports on failure to open files.
           -s[char]  Separate text columns by the single character char
                     instead of by the appropriate number of <space>
                     characters (default for char shall be <tab>).
           -t        Write neither the five-line identifying header nor the
                     five-line trailer usually supplied for each page. Quit
                     writing after the last line of each file without
                     spacing to the end of the page.
           -w width  Set the width of the line to width column positions for
                     multiple text-column output only. If the -w option is
                     not specified and the -s option is not specified, the
                     default width shall be 72. If the -w option is not
                     specified and the -s option is specified, the default
                     width shall be 512.
                     For single column output, input lines shall not be
                     truncated.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of a file to be written. If no file operands
                     are specified, or if a file operand is '-', the
                     standard input shall be used.
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be used only if no file operands are
           specified, or if a file operand is '-'.  See the INPUT FILES
           section.
## INPUT FILES         top
           The input files shall be text files.
           The file /dev/tty shall be used to read responses required by the
           -p option.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           pr:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files) and which
                     characters are defined as printable (character class
                     print).  Non-printable characters are still written to
                     standard output, but are not counted for the purpose
                     for column-width and line-length calculations.
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           LC_TIME   Determine the format of the date and time for use in
                     writing header lines.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
           TZ        Determine the timezone used to calculate date and time
                     strings written in header lines. If TZ is unset or
                     null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           If pr receives an interrupt while writing to a terminal, it shall
           flush all accumulated error messages to the screen before
           terminating.
## STDOUT         top
           The pr utility output shall be a paginated version of the
           original file (or files). This pagination shall be accomplished
           using either <form-feed> characters or a sequence of <newline>
           characters, as controlled by the -F or -f option. Page headers
           shall be generated unless the -t option is specified. The page
           headers shall be of the form:
               "\n\n%s %s Page %d\n\n\n", <output of date>, <file>, <page number>
           In the POSIX locale, the <output of date> field, representing the
           date and time of last modification of the input file (or the
           current date and time if the input file is standard input), shall
           be equivalent to the output of the following command as it would
           appear if executed at the given time:
               date "+%b %e %H:%M %Y"
           without the trailing <newline>, if the page being written is from
           standard input. If the page being written is not from standard
           input, in the POSIX locale, the same format shall be used, but
           the time used shall be the modification time of the file
           corresponding to file instead of the current time. When the
           LC_TIME locale category is not set to the POSIX locale, a
           different format and order of presentation of this field may be
           used.
           If the standard input is used instead of a file operand, the
           <file> field shall be replaced by a null string.
           If the -h option is specified, the <file> field shall be replaced
           by the header argument.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and for
           alerting the terminal when -p is specified.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           A conforming application must protect its first operand, if it
           starts with a <plus-sign>, by preceding it with the "--" argument
           that denotes the end of the options. For example, pr+x could be
           interpreted as an invalid page number or a file operand.
## EXAMPLES         top
            1. Print a numbered list of all files in the current directory:
                   ls -a | pr -n -h "Files in $(pwd)."
            2. Print file1 and file2 as a double-spaced, three-column
               listing headed by ``file list'':
                   pr -3d -h "file list" file1 file2
            3. Write file1 on file2, expanding tabs to columns 10, 19, 28,
               ...:
                   pr -e9 -t <file1 >file2
## RATIONALE         top
           This utility is one of those that does not follow the Utility
           Syntax Guidelines because of its historical origins. The standard
           developers could have added new options that obeyed the
           guidelines (and marked the old options obsolescent) or devised an
           entirely new utility; there are examples of both actions in this
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017. Because of its widespread use by
           historical applications, the standard developers decided to
           exempt this version of pr from many of the guidelines.
           Implementations are required to accept option-arguments to the
           -h, -l, -o, and -w options whether presented as part of the same
           argument or as a separate argument to pr, as suggested by the
           Utility Syntax Guidelines. The -n and -s options, however, are
           specified as in historical practice because they are frequently
           specified without their optional arguments. If a <blank> were
           allowed before the option-argument in these cases, a file operand
           could mistakenly be interpreted as an option-argument in
           historical applications.
           The text about the minimum number of lines in multi-column output
           was included to ensure that a best effort is made in balancing
           the length of the columns. There are known historical
           implementations in which, for example, 60-line files are listed
           by pr -2 as one column of 56 lines and a second of 4. Although
           this is not a problem when a full page with headers and trailers
           is produced, it would be relatively useless when used with -t.
           Historical implementations of the pr utility have differed in the
           action taken for the -f option. BSD uses it as described here for
           the -F option; System V uses it to change trailing <newline>
           characters on each page to a <form-feed> and, if standard output
           is a TTY device, sends an <alert> to standard error and reads a
           line from /dev/tty before the first page. There were strong
           arguments from both sides of this issue concerning historical
           practice and as a result the -F option was added. XSI-conformant
           systems support the System V historical actions for the -f
           option.
           The <output of date> field in the -l format is specified only for
           the POSIX locale. As noted, the format can be different in other
           locales. No mechanism for defining this is present in this volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, as the appropriate vehicle is a message catalog;
           that is, the format should be specified as a ``message''.
