## NAME         top
           curl-config - Get information about a libcurl installation
## SYNOPSIS         top
           curl-config [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           curl-config displays information about the curl and libcurl
           installation.
## OPTIONS         top
           --ca   Displays the built-in path to the CA cert bundle this
                  libcurl uses.
           --cc   Displays the compiler used to build libcurl.
           --cflags
                  Set of compiler options (CFLAGS) to use when compiling
                  files that use libcurl. Currently that is only the include
                  path to the curl include files.
           --checkfor [version]
                  Specify the oldest possible libcurl version string you
                  want, and this script will return 0 if the current
                  installation is new enough or it returns 1 and outputs a
                  text saying that the current version is not new enough.
                  (Added in 7.15.4)
           --configure
                  Displays the arguments given to configure when building
                  curl.
           --feature
                  Lists what particular main features the installed libcurl
                  was built with. At the time of writing, this list may
                  include SSL, KRB4 or IPv6. Do not assume any particular
                  order. The keywords will be separated by newlines. There
                  may be none, one, or several keywords in the list.
           --help Displays the available options.
           --libs Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options
                  you will need in order to link your application with
                  libcurl.
           --prefix
                  This is the prefix used when libcurl was installed.
                  Libcurl is then installed in $prefix/lib and its header
                  files are installed in $prefix/include and so on. The
                  prefix is set with "configure --prefix".
           --protocols
                  Lists what particular protocols the installed libcurl was
                  built to support. At the time of writing, this list may
                  include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, FILE, TELNET, LDAP, DICT
                  and many more. Do not assume any particular order. The
                  protocols will be listed using uppercase and are separated
                  by newlines. There may be none, one, or several protocols
                  in the list. (Added in 7.13.0)
           --ssl-backends
                  Lists the SSL backends that were enabled when libcurl was
                  built. It might be no, one or several names. If more than
                  one name, they will appear comma-separated. (Added in
                  7.58.0)
           --static-libs
                  Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options
                  you will need in order to link your application with
                  libcurl statically. (Added in 7.17.1)
           --version
                  Outputs version information about the installed libcurl.
           --vernum
                  Outputs version information about the installed libcurl,
                  in numerical mode.  This outputs the version number, in
                  hexadecimal, with 8 bits for each part: major, minor, and
                  patch. So that libcurl 7.7.4 would appear as 070704 and
                  libcurl 12.13.14 would appear as 0c0d0e... Note that the
                  initial zero might be omitted. (This option was broken in
                  the 7.15.0 release.)
