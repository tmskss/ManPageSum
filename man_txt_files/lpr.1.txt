    lpr(1)                         Apple Inc.                         lpr(1)
## NAME         top
           lpr - print files
## SYNOPSIS         top
           lpr [ -E ] [ -H server[:port] ] [ -U username ] [ -P
           destination[/instance] ] [ -# num-copies [ -h ] [ -l ] [ -m ] [
           -o option[=value] ] [ -p ] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -C title ] [ -J title
           ] [ -T title ] [ file(s) ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           lpr submits files for printing.  Files named on the command line
           are sent to the named printer or the default destination if no
           destination is specified.  If no files are listed on the command-
           line, lpr reads the print file from the standard input.
       THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
           CUPS provides many ways to set the default destination. The
           LPDEST and PRINTER environment variables are consulted first.  If
           neither are set, the current default set using the lpoptions(1)
           command is used, followed by the default set using the lpadmin(8)
           command.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are recognized by lpr:
           -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.
           -H server[:port]
                Specifies an alternate server.
           -C "name"
           -J "name"
           -T "name"
                Sets the job name/title.
           -P destination[/instance]
                Prints files to the named printer.
           -U username
                Specifies an alternate username.
           -# copies
                Sets the number of copies to print.
           -h   Disables banner printing. This option is equivalent to -o
                job-sheets=none.
           -l   Specifies that the print file is already formatted for the
                destination and should be sent without filtering.  This
                option is equivalent to -o raw.
           -m   Send an email on job completion.
           -o option[=value]
                Sets a job option.  See "COMMON JOB OPTIONS" below.
           -p   Specifies that the print file should be formatted with a
                shaded header with the date, time, job name, and page
                number.  This option is equivalent to -o prettyprint and is
                only useful when printing text files.
           -q   Hold job for printing.
           -r   Specifies that the named print files should be deleted after
                submitting them.
       COMMON JOB OPTIONS
           Aside from the printer-specific options reported by the
           lpoptions(1) command, the following generic options are
           available:
           -o job-sheets=name
                Prints a cover page (banner) with the document.  The "name"
                can be "classified", "confidential", "secret", "standard",
                "topsecret", or "unclassified".
           -o media=size
                Sets the page size to size. Most printers support at least
                the size names "a4", "letter", and "legal".
           -o number-up={2|4|6|9|16}
                Prints 2, 4, 6, 9, or 16 document (input) pages on each
                output page.
           -o orientation-requested=4
                Prints the job in landscape (rotated 90 degrees counter-
                clockwise).
           -o orientation-requested=5
                Prints the job in landscape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise).
           -o orientation-requested=6
                Prints the job in reverse portrait (rotated 180 degrees).
           -o print-quality=3
           -o print-quality=4
           -o print-quality=5
                Specifies the output quality - draft (3), normal (4), or
                best (5).
           -o sides=one-sided
                Prints on one side of the paper.
           -o sides=two-sided-long-edge
                Prints on both sides of the paper for portrait output.
           -o sides=two-sided-short-edge
                Prints on both sides of the paper for landscape output.
## NOTES         top
           The -c, -d, -f, -g, -i, -n, -t, -v, and -w options are not
           supported by CUPS and produce a warning message if used.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Print two copies of a document to the default printer:
               lpr -# 2 filename
           Print a double-sided legal document to a printer called "foo":
               lpr -P foo -o media=legal -o sides=two-sided-long-edge filename
           Print a presentation document 2-up to a printer called "foo":
               lpr -P foo -o number-up=2 filename
