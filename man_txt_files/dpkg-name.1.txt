## NAME         top
           dpkg-name - rename Debian packages to full package names
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dpkg-name [option...]  [--] file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This manual page documents the dpkg-name program which provides
           an easy way to rename Debian packages into their full package
           names. A full package name consists of
           package_version_architecture.package-type as specified in the
           control file of the package. The version part of the filename
           consists of the upstream version information optionally followed
           by a hyphen and the revision information. The package-type part
           comes from that field if present or fallbacks to deb.
## OPTIONS         top
           -a, --no-architecture
               The destination filename will not have the architecture
               information.
           -k, --symlink
               Create a symlink, instead of moving.
           -o, --overwrite
               Existing files will be overwritten if they have the same name
               as the destination filename.
           -s, --subdir [dir]
               Files will be moved into a subdirectory. If the directory
               given as argument exists the files will be moved into that
               directory otherwise the name of the target directory is
               extracted from the section field in the control part of the
               package. The target directory will be
               «unstable/binary-architecture/section».  If the section is
               not found in the control, then no-section is assumed, and in
               this case, as well as for sections non-free and contrib the
               target directory is «section/binary-architecture».  The
               section field is not required so a lot of packages will find
               their way to the no-section area.
               Warning: Use this option with care, it is messy.
           -c, --create-dir
               This option can used together with the -s option. If a target
               directory isn't found it will be created automatically.
               Warning: Use this option with care.
           -?, --help
               Show the usage message and exit.
           -v, --version
               Show the version and exit.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           DPKG_COLORS
               Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
               accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.
           DPKG_NLS
               If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
               Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
               i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are:
               0 and 1 (default).
## BUGS         top
           Some packages don't follow the name structure
           package_version_architecture.deb.  Packages renamed by dpkg-name
           will follow this structure. Generally this will have no impact on
           how packages are installed by dselect(1)/dpkg(1), but other
           installation tools might depend on this naming structure.
## EXAMPLES         top
           dpkg-name bar-foo.deb
               The file bar-foo.deb will be renamed to
               bar-foo_1.0-2_i386.deb or something similar (depending on
               whatever information is in the control part of bar-foo.deb).
           find /root/debian/ -name '*.deb' | xargs -n 1 dpkg-name -a
               All files with the extension deb in the directory
               /root/debian and its subdirectory's will be renamed by dpkg-
               name if required into names with no architecture information.
           find -name '*.deb' | xargs -n 1 dpkg-name -a -o -s -c
               Don't do this.  Your archive will be messed up completely
               because a lot of packages don't come with section
               information.  Don't do this.
           dpkg-deb --build debian-tmp && dpkg-name -o -s .. debian-tmp.deb
               This can be used when building new packages.
