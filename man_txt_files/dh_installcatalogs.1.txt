## NAME         top
           dh_installcatalogs - install and register SGML Catalogs
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_installcatalogs [debhelper options] [-n]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_installcatalogs is a debhelper program that installs and
           registers SGML catalogs. It complies with the Debian XML/SGML
           policy.
           Catalogs will be registered in a supercatalog, in
           /etc/sgml/package.cat.
           This command automatically adds maintainer script snippets for
           registering and unregistering the catalogs and supercatalogs
           (unless -n is used). These snippets are inserted into the
           maintainer scripts and the triggers file by dh_installdeb; see
           dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of Debhelper maintainer
           script snippets.
           A dependency on sgml-base will be added to ${misc:Depends}, so be
           sure your package uses that variable in debian/control.
## FILES         top
           debian/package.sgmlcatalogs
               Lists the catalogs to be installed per package. Each line in
               that file should be of the form "source dest", where source
               indicates where the catalog resides in the source tree, and
               dest indicates the destination location for the catalog under
               the package build area. dest should start with
               /usr/share/sgml/.
               Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
               documented in debhelper(7).
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --no-scripts
               Do not modify postinst/postrm/prerm scripts nor add an
               activation trigger.
## NOTES         top
           Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be
           called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may
           cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
           maintainer scripts.
