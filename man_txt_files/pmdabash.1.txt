## NAME         top
           pmdabash - Bourne-Again SHell trace performance metrics domain
           agent
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bash/pmdabash [-C] [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-I
           interval] [-t timeout] [-U username] configfile
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdabash is an experimental Performance Metrics Domain Agent
           (PMDA) which exports "xtrace" events from a traced bash(1)
           process.  This includes the command execution information that
           would usually be sent to standard error with the set -x option to
           the shell.
           Event metrics are exported showing each command executed, the
           function name and line number in the script, and a timestamp.
           Additionally, the process identifier for the shell and its parent
           process are exported.
           This requires bash version 4 or later.
           A brief description of the pmdabash command line options follows:
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                bash.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
                pmdabash is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
                file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
                to the standard error instead.
           -s   Amount of time (in seconds) between subsequent evaluations
                of the shell trace file descriptor(s).  The default is 2
                seconds.
           -m   Maximum amount of memory to be allowed for each event queue
                (one per traced process).  The default is 2 megabytes.
           -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                used by default.
## INSTALLATION         top
           In order for a host to export the names, help text and values for
           the bash performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bash
                # ./Install
           As soon as an instrumented shell script (see INSTRUMENTATION
           selection below) is run, with tracing enabled, new metric values
           will appear - no further setup of the agent is required.
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bash
                # ./Remove
           pmdabash is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## INSTRUMENTATION         top
           In order to allow the flow of event data between a bash(1) script
           and pmdabash, the script should take the following actions:
                #!/bin/sh
                source $PCP_DIR/etc/pcp.env
                source $PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/bashproc.sh
                pcp_trace on $@       # enable tracing
                echo "awoke, $count"
                pcp_trace off         # disable tracing
           The tracing can be enabled and disabled any number of times by
           the script.  On successful installation of the agent, several
           metrics will be available:
                $ pminfo bash
                bash.xtrace.numclients
                bash.xtrace.maxmem
                bash.xtrace.queuemem
                bash.xtrace.count
                bash.xtrace.records
                bash.xtrace.parameters.pid
                bash.xtrace.parameters.parent
                bash.xtrace.parameters.lineno
                bash.xtrace.parameters.function
                bash.xtrace.parameters.command
           When an instrumented script is running, the generation of event
           records can be verified using the pmevent(1) command, as follows:
                $ pmevent -t 1 -x '' bash.xtrace.records
                host:      localhost
                samples:   all
                bash.xtrace.records["4538 ./test-trace.sh 1 2 3"]: 5 event records

                    bash.xtrace.parameters.lineno 45
                    bash.xtrace.parameters.command "((  count++  ))"

                    bash.xtrace.parameters.lineno 47
                    bash.xtrace.parameters.command "tired 2"
                  10:00:05.000 --- event record [4] flags 0x19 (point,id,parent) ---
                    bash.xtrace.parameters.pid 4538

                    bash.xtrace.parameters.lineno 38
                    bash.xtrace.parameters.function "tired"
                    bash.xtrace.parameters.command "sleep 2"

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
