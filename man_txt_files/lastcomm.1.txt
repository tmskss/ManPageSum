    LASTCOMM(1)              General Commands Manual             LASTCOMM(1)
## NAME         top
           lastcomm -  print out information about previously executed
           commands.
## SYNOPSIS         top
           lastcomm
                  [ command-name ...  ]
                  [ user-name ...  ]
                  [ terminal-name ...  ]
                  [ OPTION ... ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           lastcomm prints out information about previously executed
           commands.  If no arguments are specified, lastcomm will print
           info about all of the commands in acct (the record file).  If
           called with one or more of command-name, user-name, or terminal-
           name, only records containing those items will be displayed.  For
           example, to find out which users used command `a.out' and which
           users were logged into `tty0', type:
                                  lastcomm a.out tty0
           This will print any entry for which `a.out' or `tty0' matches in
           any of the record's fields (command, name, or terminal).  If you
           want to find only items that match *all* of the arguments on the
           command line, you must use the '-strict-match' option.  For
           example, to list all of the executions of command a.out by user
           root on terminal tty0, type:
            lastcomm --strict-match --command a.out --user root --tty tty0
           The order of the arguments is not important.
           For each entry the following information is printed:
              + command name of the process
              + flags, as recorded by the system accounting routines:
                   S -- command executed by super-user
                   F -- command executed after a fork but without a
           following exec
                   C -- command run in PDP-11 compatibility mode (VAX only)
                   D -- command terminated with the generation of a core
           file
                   X -- command was terminated with the signal SIGTERM
              + the name of the user who ran the process
              + time the process started
## OPTIONS         top
           --strict-match
                  Print only entries that match *all* of the arguments on
                  the command line.
           --print-controls
                  Print control characters.
           --user name
                  List records for user with name.  This is useful if you're
                  trying to match a username that happens to be the same as
                  a command (e.g., ed ).
           --command name
                  List records for command name.
           --tty name
                  List records for tty name.
           --forwards
                  Read file forwards instead of backwards. This avoids
                  trying to seek on the file and can be used to read from a
                  pipe. This must be specified prior to any -f arguments.
           -f filename, --file filename
                  Read from the file filename instead of acct.  A filename
                  of "-" will result in reading from stdin. This must either
                  be the first -f option, or --forwards must precede all -f
                  options.
           --ahz hz
                  Use this flag to tell the program what AHZ should be (in
                  hertz).  This option is useful if you are trying to view
                  an acct file created on another machine which has the same
                  byte order and file format as your current machine, but
                  has a different value for AHZ.
           -p, --show-paging
                  Print paging statistics.
           --pid  Show PID and PPID of the process if acct version 3 format
                  is supported by kernel.
           --pid  Add pid of the process and pid of the process parent to
                  the output (pid is the last but one and parent pid the
                  last column).  These values are shown only when they are
                  generated by acct function (depends on the version of
                  kernel)
           --debug
                  Print verbose internal information.
           -V, --version
                  Print the version number of lastcomm.
           -h, --help
                  Prints the usage string and default locations of system
                  files to standard output and exits.
## FILES         top
           acct
                  The system wide process accounting file. See acct(5) (or
                  pacct(5)) for further details.  /var/log/account
                         This directory contains pacct files which contain
                         the binary process accounting data as written by
                         the kernel.
