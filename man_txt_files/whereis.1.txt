    WHEREIS(1)                    User Commands                   WHEREIS(1)
## NAME         top
           whereis - locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a
           command
## SYNOPSIS         top
           whereis [options] [-BMS directory... -f] name...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           whereis locates the binary, source and manual files for the
           specified command names. The supplied names are first stripped of
           leading pathname components. Prefixes of s. resulting from use of
           source code control are also dealt with. whereis then attempts to
           locate the desired program in the standard Linux places, and in
           the places specified by $PATH and $MANPATH.
           The search restrictions (options -b, -m and -s) are cumulative
           and apply to the subsequent name patterns on the command line.
           Any new search restriction resets the search mask. For example,
              whereis -bm ls tr -m gcc
           searches for "ls" and "tr" binaries and man pages, and for "gcc"
           man pages only.
           The options -B, -M and -S reset search paths for the subsequent
           name patterns. For example,
              whereis -m ls -M /usr/share/man/man1 -f cal
           searches for "ls" man pages in all default paths, but for "cal"
           in the /usr/share/man/man1 directory only.
## OPTIONS         top
           -b
               Search for binaries.
           -m
               Search for manuals.
           -s
               Search for sources.
           -u
               Only show the command names that have unusual entries. A
               command is said to be unusual if it does not have just one
               entry of each explicitly requested type. Thus 'whereis -m -u
               *' asks for those files in the current directory which have
               no documentation file, or more than one.
           -B list
               Limit the places where whereis searches for binaries, by a
               whitespace-separated list of directories.
           -M list
               Limit the places where whereis searches for manuals and
               documentation in Info format, by a whitespace-separated list
               of directories.
           -S list
               Limit the places where whereis searches for sources, by a
               whitespace-separated list of directories.
           -f
               Terminates the directory list and signals the start of
               filenames. It must be used when any of the -B, -M, or -S
               options is used.
           -l
               Output the list of effective lookup paths that whereis is
               using. When none of -B, -M, or -S is specified, the option
               will output the hard-coded paths that the command was able to
               find on the system.
           -g
               Interpret the next names as a glob(7) patterns. whereis
               always compares only filenames (aka basename) and never
               complete path. Using directory names in the pattern has no
               effect. Don’t forget that the shell interprets the pattern
               when specified on the command line without quotes. It’s
               necessary to use quotes for the name, for example:
                  whereis -g 'find*'
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## FILE SEARCH PATHS         top
           By default whereis tries to find files from hard-coded paths,
           which are defined with glob patterns. The command attempts to use
           the contents of $PATH and $MANPATH environment variables as
           default search path. The easiest way to know what paths are in
           use is to add the -l listing option. Effects of the -B, -M, and
           -S are displayed with -l.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           WHEREIS_DEBUG=all
               enables debug output.
## EXAMPLES         top
           To find all files in /usr/bin which are not documented in
           /usr/man/man1 or have no source in /usr/src:
              cd /usr/bin
              whereis -u -ms -M /usr/man/man1 -S /usr/src -f *
