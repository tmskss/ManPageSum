    PMLOGSUMMARY(1)          General Commands Manual         PMLOGSUMMARY(1)
## NAME         top
           pmlogsummary - calculate averages of metrics stored in a set of
           PCP archives
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmlogsummary [-abfFHiIlmMNsvVxyz?]  [-B nbins] [-n pmnsfile] [-p
           precision] [-S starttime] [-T endtime] [-Z timezone] archive
           [metricname ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmlogsummary prints statistical information about metrics of
           numeric type contained within the files of a set of Performance
           Co-Pilot (PCP) archive logs.  The default output prints time
           averages for both counter and non-counter metrics.  The set of
           archive logs is identified by archive, which is a comma-separated
           list of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive
           or the name of a directory containing one or more archives.  The
           archive logs are typically created using pmlogger(1).
           The metrics of interest are named in the metricname arguments.
           If metricname is a non-leaf node in the Performance Metrics Name
           Space (PMNS(5)), then pmlogsummary will recursively descend the
           PMNS and report on all leaf nodes.  If no metricname argument is
           given, the root of the namespace is used.
           Metrics with counter semantics are converted to rates before
           being evaluated.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a, --all
                Print all information.  This is equivalent to -blmMy.
           -b   Print both forms of averaging, that is both stochastic and
                time averaging.
           -B nbins, --bins=nbins
                Print the approximate distribution of values, using
                histogram bins such that the value range (minimum - maximum)
                for each metric is divided equally into nbins bins, and each
                bin accumulates the frequency of observed values in the
                corresponding range.  Refer to the ``OUTPUT FORMAT'' section
                below for a description of how the distribution of values is
                reported).
           -f   Spreadsheet format - the tab character is used to delimit
                each field printed.  This option is intended to allow
                pmlogsummary output to be imported directly into common
                spreadsheet applications.
           -F   Spreadsheet format - the comma character is used to delimit
                each field printed.  This option is intended to allow
                pmlogsummary output to be imported directly into common
                spreadsheet applications which support the Comma Separated
                Value (.csv) format.
           -H, --header
                Print a one-line header at the start showing what each field
                represents.
           -i, --mintime
                Also print the time at which the minimum value was logged.
                The format of this timestamp is described in the ``OUTPUT
                FORMAT'' section below.
           -I, --maxtime
                Also print the time at which the maximum value was logged.
                The format of this timestamp is described in the ``OUTPUT
                FORMAT'' section below.
           -l, --label
                Also print the archive label, showing the log format
                version, the time and date for the start and end of the
                archive time window, and the host from which the performance
                metrics values were collected.
           -m, --minimum
                Also print the minimum logged value for each metric.
           -M, --maximum
                Also print the maximum logged value for each metric.
           -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
                Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5))
                from the file pmnsfile.
           -N   Suppress any warnings resulting from individual archive
                fetches (default).
           -p precision, --precision=precision
                Print all floating point numbers with precision digits after
                the decimal place.
           -s, --sum
                Print (only) the sum of all logged values for each metric.
           -S starttime, --start=starttime
                Set the starttime of the time window.  Refer to PCPIntro(1)
                for a complete description of the syntax for starttime.
           -T endtime, --finish=endtime
                Set the endtime of the time window.  Refer to PCPIntro(1)
                for a complete description of the syntax for endtime.
           -v, --verbose
                Report (verbosely) on warnings resulting from individual
                archive fetches.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -x   Print stochastic averages instead of the default (time
                averages).
           -y, --samples
                Also print the number of samples encountered in the set of
                archives for each metric.
           -z, --hostzone
                Change the timezone to the local timezone at the host that
                is the source of the performance metrics, as specified in
                the label record of the archive log.
           -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
                By default, pmlogsummary reports the time of day according
                to the local timezone on the system where pmlogsummary is
                run.  Change the timezone to timezone in the format of the
                environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## OUTPUT FORMAT         top
           The pmlogsummary output format is spartan as it is intended to be
           post-processed with standard tools.  This means that there is no
           annotation associated with each output field which would make
           processing harder.  The intention is that pmlogsummary output be
           massaged into a format which can be used by a spreadsheet
           program, is suitable for inclusion in a web page, or whatever.
           For each metric, pmlogsummary produces a single output line as
           follows:
              metricname  value(s) units
           For metrics with multiple instances, pmlogsummary produces
           multiple lines of output as follows:
              metricname ["instance 1"] value(s) units
              metricname ["instance 2"] value(s) units
              metricname ["instance N"] value(s) units
           The printed value(s) for each metric always follow this order:
           stochastic average, time average, minimum, minimum timestamp,
           maximum, maximum timestamp, count, [bin 1 range], bin 1 count,
           ... [bin nbins range], bin nbins count.  The individual values
           for each metric are space-separated (unless the -f option is
           used).
           All counter metrics which are measured in units of time will be
           converted to seconds before being rate converted and used in the
           pmlogsummary calculations.  The values calculated for these
           metrics are also printed in seconds.
           The units will be displayed in the format described by
           pmUnitsStr(3).
           Given either of the -i or -I options, pmlogsummary produces two
           different timestamp formats, depending on the interval over which
           it is run.  For an interval greater than 24 hours, the date is
           displayed in addition to the time at which the maxima and/or
           minima occurred.  If the extent of the data being checked is less
           than 24 hours, a more precise format is used (time is displayed
           with millisecond precision, but without the date).
## NOTES         top
           The average for an individual metric is calculated as follows:
           Non-counter metrics are averaged using stochastic averaging -
           each observation has an equal weighting towards the calculation
           of the average (the sum of all values divided by the total number
           of values, for each metric).
           Counter metrics are averaged using time averaging (by default),
           but the -x option can be used to specify that counters be
           averaged using the stochastic method instead.  When calculating a
           time average, the sum of the product of each sample value
           multiplied by the time difference between each sample, is divided
           by the total time over which that metric was logged.
           Counter metrics whose measurements do not span 90% of the set of
           archives will be printed with the metric name prefixed by an
           asterisk (*).

           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
