    UL(1)                         User Commands                        UL(1)
## NAME         top
           ul - do underlining
## SYNOPSIS         top
           ul [options] [file...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           ul reads the named files (or standard input if none are given)
           and translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence which
           indicates underlining for the terminal in use, as specified by
           the environment variable TERM. The terminfo database is read to
           determine the appropriate sequences for underlining. If the
           terminal is incapable of underlining but is capable of a standout
           mode, then that is used instead. If the terminal can overstrike,
           or handles underlining automatically, ul degenerates to cat(1).
           If the terminal cannot underline, underlining is ignored.
## OPTIONS         top
           -i, --indicated
               Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing
               appropriate dashes `-'; this is useful when you want to look
               at the underlining which is present in an nroff output stream
               on a crt-terminal.
           -t, -T, --terminal terminal
               Override the environment variable TERM with the specified
               terminal type.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           The following environment variable is used:
           TERM
               The TERM variable is used to relate a tty device with its
               device capability description (see terminfo(5)). TERM is set
               at login time, either by the default terminal type specified
               in /etc/ttys or as set during the login process by the user
               in their login file (see setenv(3)).
## HISTORY         top
           The ul command appeared in 3.0BSD.
## BUGS         top
           nroff usually outputs a series of backspaces and underlines
           intermixed with the text to indicate underlining. No attempt is
           made to optimize the backward motion.
