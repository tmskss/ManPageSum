## NAME         top
           flatpak-build-update-repo - Create a repository from a build
           directory
## SYNOPSIS         top
           flatpak build-update-repo [OPTION...] LOCATION
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Updates repository metadata for the repository at LOCATION. This
           command generates an OSTree summary file that lists the contents
           of the repository. The summary is used by flatpak remote-ls and
           other commands to display the contents of remote repositories.
           After this command, LOCATION can be used as the repository
           location for flatpak remote-add, either by exporting it over
           http, or directly with a file: url.
## OPTIONS         top
           The following options are understood:
           -h, --help
               Show help options and exit.
           --redirect-url=URL
               Redirect this repo to a new URL.
           --title=TITLE
               A title for the repository, e.g. for display in a UI. The
               title is stored in the repository summary.
           --comment=COMMENT
               A single-line comment for the remote, e.g. for display in a
               UI. The comment is stored in the repository summary.
           --description=DESCRIPTION
               A full-paragraph description for the remote, e.g. for display
               in a UI. The description is stored in the repository summary.
           --homepage=URL
               URL for a website for the remote, e.g. for display in a UI.
               The url is stored in the repository summary.
           --icon=URL
               URL for an icon for the remote, e.g. for display in a UI. The
               url is stored in the repository summary.
           --default-branch=BRANCH
               A default branch for the repository, mainly for use in a UI.
           --gpg-import=FILE
               Import a new default GPG public key from the given file.
           --collection-id=COLLECTION-ID
               The globally unique identifier of the remote repository, to
               allow mirrors to be grouped. This must be set to a globally
               unique reverse DNS string if the repository is to be made
               publicly available. If a collection ID is already set on an
               existing repository, this will update it. If not specified,
               the existing collection ID will be left unchanged.
           --deploy-collection-id
               Deploy the collection ID (set using --collection-id) in the
               static remote configuration for all clients. This is
               irrevocable once published in a repository. Use it to decide
               when to roll out a collection ID to users of an existing
               repository. If constructing a new repository which has a
               collection ID, you should typically always pass this option.
           --deploy-sideload-collection-id
               This is similar to --deploy-collection-id, but it only
               applies the deploy to clients newer than flatpak 1.7 which
               supports the new form of sideloads.
           --gpg-sign=KEYID
               Sign the commit with this GPG key. This option can be used
               multiple times.
           --gpg-homedir=PATH
               GPG Homedir to use when looking for keyrings
           --generate-static-deltas
               Generate static deltas for all references. This generates
               from-empty and delta static files that allow for faster
               download.
           --static-delta-jobs=NUM-JOBS
               Limit the number of parallel jobs creating static deltas. The
               default is the number of cpus.
           --static-delta-ignore-ref=PATTERN
               Don't generate deltas for runtime or application id matching
               this pattern. For instance,
               --static-delta-ignore-ref=*.Sources means there will not be
               any deltas for source refs.
           --prune
               Remove unreferenced objects in repo.
           --prune-depth
               Only keep at most this number of old versions for any
               particular ref. Default is -1 which means infinite.
           -v, --verbose
               Print debug information during command processing.
           --ostree-verbose
               Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
