## NAME         top
           qselect — select batch jobs
## SYNOPSIS         top
           qselect [-a [op]date_time] [-A account_string] [-c [op]interval]
               [-h hold_list] [-l resource_list] [-N name] [-p [op]priority]
               [-q destination] [-r y|n] [-s states] [-u user_list]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           To select a set of batch jobs is to return the batch
           job_identifiers for each batch job that meets a list of selection
           criteria. A set of batch jobs is selected by a request to a batch
           server. The qselect utility is a user-accessible batch client
           that requests the selection of batch jobs.
           Upon successful completion, the qselect utility shall have
           returned a list of zero or more batch job_identifiers that meet
           the criteria specified by the options and option-arguments
           presented to the utility.
           The qselect utility shall select batch jobs by sending a Select
           Jobs Request to a batch server. The qselect utility shall not
           exit until the server replies to each request generated.
           For each option presented to the qselect utility, the utility
           shall restrict the set of selected batch jobs as described in the
           OPTIONS section.
           The qselect utility shall not restrict selection of batch jobs
           except by authorization and as required by the options presented
           to the utility.
           When an option is specified with a mandatory or optional op
           component to the option-argument, then op shall specify a
           relation between the value of a certain batch job attribute and
           the value component of the option-argument. If an op is allowable
           on an option, then the description of the option letter indicates
           the op as either mandatory or optional. Acceptable strings for
           the op component, and the relation the string indicates, are
           shown in the following list:
           .eq.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
                   is equal to the value represented by the option-argument.
           .ge.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
                   is greater than or equal to the value represented by the
                   option-argument.
           .gt.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
                   is greater than the value represented by the option-
                   argument.
           .lt.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
                   is less than the value represented by the option-
                   argument.
           .le.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
                   is less than or equal to the value represented by the
                   option-argument.
           .ne.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
                   is not equal to the value represented by the option-
                   argument.
## OPTIONS         top
           The qselect utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
           of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
           The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
           -a [op]date_time
                     Restrict selection to a specific time, or a range of
                     times.
                     The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
                     which the value of the Execution_Time attribute is
                     related to the Epoch equivalent of the local time
                     expressed by the value of the date_time component of
                     the option-argument in the manner indicated by the
                     value of the op component of the option-argument.
                     The qselect utility shall accept a date_time component
                     of the option-argument that conforms to the syntax of
                     the time operand of the touch utility.
                     If the op component of the option-argument is not
                     presented to the qselect utility, the utility shall
                     select batch jobs for which the Execution_Time
                     attribute is equal to the date_time component of the
                     option-argument.
                     When comparing times, the qselect utility shall use the
                     following definitions for the op component of the
                     option-argument:
                     .eq.    The time represented by value of the
                             Execution_Time attribute of the batch job is
                             equal to the time represented by the date_time
                             component of the option-argument.
                     .ge.    The time represented by value of the
                             Execution_Time attribute of the batch job is
                             after or equal to the time represented by the
                             date_time component of the option-argument.
                     .gt.    The time represented by value of the
                             Execution_Time attribute of the batch job is
                             after the time represented by the date_time
                             component of the option-argument.
                     .lt.    The time represented by value of the
                             Execution_Time attribute of the batch job is
                             before the time represented by the date_time
                             component of the option-argument.
                     .le.    The time represented by value of the
                             Execution_Time attribute of the batch job is
                             before or equal to the time represented by the
                             date_time component of the option-argument.
                     .ne.    The time represented by value of the
                             Execution_Time attribute of the batch job is
                             not equal to the time represented by the
                             date_time component of the option-argument.
                     The qselect utility shall accept the defined character
                     strings for the op component of the option-argument.
           -A account_string
                     Restrict selection to the batch jobs charging a
                     specified account.
                     The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
                     which the value of the Account_Name attribute of the
                     batch job matches the value of the account_string
                     option-argument.
                     The syntax of the account_string option-argument is
                     unspecified.
           -c [op]interval
                     Restrict selection to batch jobs within a range of
                     checkpoint intervals.
                     The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
                     which the value of the Checkpoint attribute relates to
                     the value of the interval component of the option-
                     argument in the manner indicated by the value of the op
                     component of the option-argument.
                     If the op component of the option-argument is omitted,
                     the qselect utility shall select batch jobs for which
                     the value of the Checkpoint attribute is equal to the
                     value of the interval component of the option-argument.
                     When comparing checkpoint intervals, the qselect
                     utility shall use the following definitions for the op
                     component of the option-argument:
                     .eq.    The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the
                             batch job equals the value of the interval
                             component of the option-argument.
                     .ge.    The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the
                             batch job is greater than or equal to the value
                             of the interval component option-argument.
                     .gt.    The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the
                             batch job is greater than the value of the
                             interval component option-argument.
                     .lt.    The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the
                             batch job is less than the value of the
                             interval component option-argument.
                     .le.    The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the
                             batch job is less than or equal to the value of
                             the interval component option-argument.
                     .ne.    The value of the Checkpoint attribute of the
                             batch job does not equal the value of the
                             interval component option-argument.
                     The qselect utility shall accept the defined character
                     strings for the op component of the option-argument.
                     The ordering relationship for the values of the
                     interval option-argument is defined to be:
                         `n' .gt. `s' .gt. `c=minutes' .ge. `c'
                     When comparing Checkpoint attributes with an interval
                     having the value of the single character 'u', only
                     equality or inequality are valid comparisons.
           -h hold_list
                     Restrict selection to batch jobs that have a specific
                     type of hold.
                     The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
                     which the value of the Hold_Types attribute matches the
                     value of the hold_list option-argument.
                     The qselect -h option shall accept a value for the
                     hold_list option-argument that is a string of
                     alphanumeric characters in the portable character set
                     (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                     Section 6.1, Portable Character Set).
                     The qselect utility shall accept a value for the
                     hold_list option-argument that is a string of one or
                     more of the characters 'u', 's', or 'o', or the single
                     character 'n'.
                     Each unique character in the hold_list option-argument
                     of the qselect utility is defined as follows, each
                     representing a different hold type:
                     u     USER
                     s     SYSTEM
                     o     OPERATOR
                     If any of these characters are duplicated in the
                     hold_list option-argument, the duplicates shall be
                     ignored.
                     The qselect utility shall consider it an error if any
                     hold type other than 'n' is combined with hold type
                     'n'.
                     Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                     of the characters 'u', 's', 'o', or 'n' within the
                     hold_list option-argument. The qselect utility shall
                     permit the repetition of characters, but shall not
                     assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.
                     An implementation may define other hold types. The
                     conformance document for an implementation shall
                     describe any additional hold types, how they are
                     specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                     the behavior of the utility.
           -l resource_list
                     Restrict selection to batch jobs with specified
                     resource limits and attributes.
                     The qselect utility shall accept a resource_list
                     option-argument with the following syntax:
                         resource_name op value [,,resource_name op value,, ...]
                     When comparing resource values, the qselect utility
                     shall use the following definitions for the op
                     component of the option-argument:
                     .eq.    The value of the resource of the same name in
                             the Resource_List attribute of the batch job
                             equals the value of the value component of the
                             option-argument.
                     .ge.    The value of the resource of the same name in
                             the Resource_List attribute of the batch job is
                             greater than or equal to the value of the value
                             component of the option-argument.
                     .gt.    The value of the resource of the same name in
                             the Resource_List attribute of the batch job is
                             greater than the value of the value component
                             of the option-argument.
                     .lt.    The value of the resource of the same name in
                             the Resource_List attribute of the batch job is
                             less than the value of the value component of
                             the option-argument.
                     .ne.    The value of the resource of the same name in
                             the Resource_List attribute of the batch job
                             does not equal the value of the value component
                             of the option-argument.
                     .le.    The value of the resource of the same name in
                             the Resource_List attribute of the batch job is
                             less than or equal to the value of the value
                             component of the option-argument.
                     When comparing the limit of a Resource_List attribute
                     with the value component of the option-argument, if the
                     limit, the value, or both are non-numeric, only
                     equality or inequality are valid comparisons.
                     The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
                     which the values of the resource_names listed in the
                     resource_list option-argument match the corresponding
                     limits of the Resource_List attribute of the batch job.
                     Limits of resource_names present in the Resource_List
                     attribute of the batch job that have no corresponding
                     values in the resource_list option-argument shall not
                     be considered when selecting batch jobs.
           -N name   Restrict selection to batch jobs with a specified name.
                     The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
                     which the value of the Job_Name attribute matches the
                     value of the name option-argument. The string specified
                     in the name option-argument shall be passed,
                     uninterpreted, to the server. This allows an
                     implementation to match ``wildcard'' patterns against
                     batch job names.
                     An implementation shall describe in the conformance
                     document the format it supports for matching against
                     the Job_Name attribute.
           -p [op]priority
                     Restrict selection to batch jobs of the specified
                     priority or range of priorities.
                     The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
                     which the value of the Priority attribute of the batch
                     job relates to the value of the priority component of
                     the option-argument in the manner indicated by the
                     value of the op component of the option-argument.
                     If the op component of the option-argument is omitted,
                     the qselect utility shall select batch jobs for which
                     the value of the Priority attribute of the batch job is
                     equal to the value of the priority component of the
                     option-argument.
                     When comparing priority values, the qselect utility
                     shall use the following definitions for the op
                     component of the option-argument:
                     .eq.    The value of the Priority attribute of the
                             batch job equals the value of the priority
                             component of the option-argument.
                     .ge.    The value of the Priority attribute of the
                             batch job is greater than or equal to the value
                             of the priority component option-argument.
                     .gt.    The value of the Priority attribute of the
                             batch job is greater than the value of the
                             priority component option-argument.
                     .lt.    The value of the Priority attribute of the
                             batch job is less than the value of the
                             priority component option-argument.
                     .lt.    The value of the Priority attribute of the
                             batch job is less than or equal to the value of
                             the priority component option-argument.
                     .ne.    The value of the Priority attribute of the
                             batch job does not equal the value of the
                             priority component option-argument.
           -q destination
                     Restrict selection to the specified batch queue or
                     server, or both.
                     The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs that
                     are located at the destination indicated by the value
                     of the destination option-argument.
                     The destination defines a batch queue, a server, or a
                     batch queue at a server.
                     The qselect utility shall accept an option-argument for
                     the -q option that conforms to the syntax for a
                     destination. If the -q option is not presented to the
                     qselect utility, the utility shall select batch jobs
                     from all batch queues at the default batch server.
                     If the option-argument describes only a batch queue,
                     the qselect utility shall select only batch jobs from
                     the batch queue of the specified name at the default
                     batch server. The means by which qselect determines the
                     default server is implementation-defined.
                     If the option-argument describes only a batch server,
                     the qselect utility shall select batch jobs from all
                     the batch queues at that batch server.
                     If the option-argument describes both a batch queue and
                     a batch server, the qselect utility shall select only
                     batch jobs from the specified batch queue at the
                     specified server.
           -r y|n    Restrict selection to batch jobs with the specified
                     rerunability status.
                     The qselect utility shall select only batch jobs for
                     which the value of the Rerunable attribute of the batch
                     job matches the value of the option-argument.
                     The qselect utility shall accept a value for the
                     option-argument that consists of either the single
                     character 'y' or the single character 'n'.  The
                     character 'y' represents the value TRUE, and the
                     character 'n' represents the value FALSE.
           -s states Restrict selection to batch jobs in the specified
                     states.
                     The qselect utility shall accept an option-argument
                     that consists of any combination of the characters 'e',
                     'q', 'r', 'w', 'h', and 't'.
                     Conforming applications shall not repeat any character
                     in the option-argument. The qselect utility shall
                     permit the repetition of characters in the option-
                     argument, but shall not assign additional meaning to
                     repeated characters.
                     The qselect utility shall interpret the characters in
                     the states option-argument as follows:
                     e     Represents the EXITING state.
                     q     Represents the QUEUED state.
                     r     Represents the RUNNING state.
                     t     Represents the TRANSITING state.
                     h     Represents the HELD state.
                     w     Represents the WAITING state.
                     For each character in the states option-argument, the
                     qselect utility shall select batch jobs in the
                     corresponding state.
           -u user_list
                     Restrict selection to batch jobs owned by the specified
                     user names.
                     The qselect utility shall select only the batch jobs of
                     those users specified in the user_list option-argument.
                     The qselect utility shall accept a user_list option-
                     argument that conforms to the following syntax:
                         username[@host][,,username[@host],, ...]
                     The qselect utility shall accept only one user name
                     that is missing a corresponding host name. The qselect
                     utility shall accept only one user name per named host.

## EXAMPLES         top
           The following example shows how a user might use the qselect
           utility in conjunction with the qdel utility to delete all of his
           or her jobs in the queued state without affecting any jobs that
           are already running:
               qdel $(qselect -s q)
           or:
               qselect -s q || xargs qdel
## RATIONALE         top
           The qselect utility allows users to acquire a list of job
           identifiers that match user-specified selection criteria. The
           list of identifiers returned by the qselect utility conforms to
           the syntax of the batch job identifier list processed by a
           utility such as qmove, qdel, and qrls.  The qselect utility is
           thus a powerful tool for causing another batch system utility to
           act upon a set of jobs that match a list of selection criteria.
           The options of the qselect utility let the user apply a number of
           useful filters for selecting jobs. Each option further restricts
           the selection of jobs. Many of the selection options allow the
           specification of a relational operator. The FORTRAN-like syntax
           of the operator—that is, ".lt."—was chosen rather than the C-like
           "<=" meta-characters.
           The -a option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to those
           that have been submitted (or altered) to wait until a particular
           time. The time period is determined by the argument of this
           option, which includes both a time and an operator—it is thus
           possible to select jobs waiting until a specific time, jobs
           waiting until after a certain time, or those waiting for a time
           before the specified time.
           The -A option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to those
           that have been submitted (or altered) to charge a particular
           account.
           The -c option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to those
           whose checkpointing interval falls within the specified range.
           The -l option allows users to select those jobs whose resource
           limits fall within the range indicated by the value of the
           option. For example, a user could select those jobs for which the
           CPU time limit is greater than two hours.
           The -N option allows users to select jobs by job name. For
           instance, all the parts of a task that have been divided in
           parallel jobs might be given the same name, and thus manipulated
           as a group by means of this option.
           The -q option allows users to select jobs in a specified queue.
           The -r option allows users to select only those jobs with a
           specified rerun criteria. For instance, a user might select only
           those jobs that can be rerun for use with the qrerun utility.
           The -s option allows users to select only those jobs that are in
           a certain state.
           The -u option allows users to select jobs that have been
           submitted to execute under a particular account.
           The selection criteria provided by the options of the qselect
           utility allow users to select jobs based on all the appropriate
           attributes that can be assigned to jobs by the qsub utility.
           Historically, the qselect utility has not been a part of existing
           practice; it is an improvement that has been introduced in this
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           The qselect utility may be removed in a future version.
