## NAME         top
           pmdaunbound - Unbound resolver PMDA
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdaunbound is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
           exports metric values about the Unbound DNS resolver using the
           unbound-control(8) stats_noreset command.
           This gives lots of insight into query types, response time, cache
           hits/misses, etc. Please see the unbound-control(8) man page for
           explanation about each statistics counter.
           Further details on the Unbound DNS resolver can be found at
           https://unbound.net/ .
## INSTALLATION         top
           Install the Unbound PMDA by using the Install script as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/unbound
               # ./Install
           To uninstall, do the following as root:
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/unbound
               # ./Remove
           pmdaunbound is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
           directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## FILES         top

               installation script for the pmdaunbound agent
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/unbound/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdaunbound agent
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/unbound.log
               default log file for error messages from pmdaunbound
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
