## NAME         top
           whatis - display one-line manual page descriptions
## SYNOPSIS         top
           whatis [-dlv?V] [-r|-w] [-s list] [-m system[,...]] [-M path] [-L
           locale] [-C file] name ...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Each manual page has a short description available within it.
           whatis searches the manual page names and displays the manual
           page descriptions of any name matched.
           name may contain wildcards (-w) or be a regular expression (-r).
           Using these options, it may be necessary to quote the name or
           escape (\) the special characters to stop the shell from
           interpreting them.
           index databases are used during the search, and are updated by
           the mandb program.  Depending on your installation, this may be
           run by a periodic cron job, or may need to be run manually after
           new manual pages have been installed.  To produce an old style
           text whatis database from the relative index database, issue the
           command:
           whatis -M manpath -w '*' | sort > manpath/whatis
           where manpath is a manual page hierarchy such as /usr/man.
## OPTIONS         top
           -d, --debug
                  Print debugging information.
           -v, --verbose
                  Print verbose warning messages.
           -r, --regex
                  Interpret each name as a regular expression.  If a name
                  matches any part of a page name, a match will be made.
                  This option causes whatis to be somewhat slower due to the
                  nature of database searches.
           -w, --wildcard
                  Interpret each name as a pattern containing shell style
                  wildcards.  For a match to be made, an expanded name must
                  match the entire page name.  This option causes whatis to
                  be somewhat slower due to the nature of database searches.
           -l, --long
                  Do not trim output to the terminal width.  Normally,
                  output will be truncated to the terminal width to avoid
                  ugly results from poorly-written NAME sections.
           -s list, --sections=list, --section=list
                  Search only the given manual sections.  list is a colon-
                  or comma-separated list of sections.  If an entry in list
                  is a simple section, for example "3", then the displayed
                  list of descriptions will include pages in sections "3",
                  "3perl", "3x", and so on; while if an entry in list has an
                  extension, for example "3perl", then the list will only
                  include pages in that exact part of the manual section.
           -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
                  If this system has access to other operating systems'
                  manual page names, they can be accessed using this option.
                  To search NewOS's manual page names, use the option -m
                  NewOS.
                  The system specified can be a combination of comma
                  delimited operating system names.  To include a search of
                  the native operating system's manual page names, include
                  the system name man in the argument string.  This option
                  will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.
           -M path, --manpath=path
                  Specify an alternate set of colon-delimited manual page
                  hierarchies to search.  By default, whatis uses the
                  $MANPATH environment variable, unless it is empty or
                  unset, in which case it will determine an appropriate
                  manpath based on your $PATH environment variable.  This
                  option overrides the contents of $MANPATH.
           -L locale, --locale=locale
                  whatis will normally determine your current locale by a
                  call to the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates
                  various environment variables, possibly including
                  $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the
                  determined value, use this option to supply a locale
                  string directly to whatis.  Note that it will not take
                  effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output
                  such as the help message will always be displayed in the
                  initially determined locale.
           -C file, --config-file=file
                  Use this user configuration file rather than the default
                  of ~/.manpath.
           -?, --help
                  Print a help message and exit.
           --usage
                  Print a short usage message and exit.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0      Successful program execution.
           1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.
           2      Operational error.
           16     Nothing was found that matched the criteria specified.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it
                  had been specified as the argument to the -m option.
           MANPATH
                  If $MANPATH is set, its value is interpreted as the colon-
                  delimited manual page hierarchy search path to use.
                  See the SEARCH PATH section of manpath(5) for the default
                  behaviour and details of how this environment variable is
                  handled.
           MANWIDTH
                  If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the terminal
                  width (see the --long option).  If it is not set, the
                  terminal width will be calculated using the value of
                  $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling back to 80
                  characters if all else fails.
## FILES         top
           /usr/share/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
                  A traditional global index database cache.
           /var/cache/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
                  An FHS compliant global index database cache.
           /usr/share/man/.../whatis
                  A traditional whatis text database.
