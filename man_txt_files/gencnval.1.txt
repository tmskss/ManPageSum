## NAME         top
           gencnval - compile the converters aliases file
## SYNOPSIS         top
           gencnval [ -h, -?, --help ] [ -v, --verbose ] [ -c, --copyright ]
           [ -s, --sourcedir source ] [ -d, --destdir destination ] [
           converterfile ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           gencnval converts the ICU aliases file converterfile into the
           binary file cnvalias.icu.  This binary file can then be read
           directly by ICU, or used by pkgdata(1) for incorporation into a
           larger archive or library.
           If converterfile is not provided, the default ICU convrtrs.txt
           file is used.
## OPTIONS         top
           -h, -?, --help
                  Print help about usage and exit.
           -v, --verbose
                  Display verbose output. This information can include
                  information about conflicting aliases and the converters
                  the aliases resolve to.
           -c, --copyright
                  Include a copyright notice in the binary data.
           -s, --sourcedir source
                  Set the source directory to source.  The default source
                  directory is specified by the environment variable
                  ICU_DATA.
           -d, --destdir destination
                  Set the destination directory to destination.  The default
                  destination directory is specified by the environment
                  variable ICU_DATA.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           ICU_DATA
                  Specifies the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to
                  ${prefix}/share/icu/73.1/.  Some tools in ICU depend on
                  the presence of the trailing slash. It is thus important
                  to make sure that it is present if ICU_DATA is set.
## FILES         top
           icu/source/data/mappings/convrtrs.txt
                  Description of ICU's converters and their aliases. This
                  data file is not normally installed, and it is available
                  as a part of ICU source code.
