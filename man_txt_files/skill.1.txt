## NAME         top
           skill, snice - send a signal or report process status
## SYNOPSIS         top
           skill [signal] [options] expression
           snice [new priority] [options] expression
## DESCRIPTION         top
           These tools are obsolete and unportable.  The command syntax is
           poorly defined.  Consider using the killall, pkill, and pgrep
           commands instead.
           The default signal for skill is TERM.  Use -l or -L to list
           available signals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT,
           KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.  Alternate signals may be specified in
           three ways: -9 -SIGKILL -KILL.
           The default priority for snice is +4.  Priority numbers range
           from +20 (slowest) to -20 (fastest).  Negative priority numbers
           are restricted to administrative users.
## OPTIONS         top
           -f, --fast
                  Fast mode.  This option has not been implemented.
           -i, --interactive
                  Interactive use.  You will be asked to approve each
                  action.
           -l, --list
                  List all signal names.
           -L, --table
                  List all signal names in a nice table.
           -n, --no-action
                  No action; perform a simulation of events that would occur
                  but do not actually change the system.
           -v, --verbose
                  Verbose; explain what is being done.
           -w, --warnings
                  Enable warnings.  This option has not been implemented.
           -h, --help
                  Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
                  Display version information.
## PROCESS SELECTION OPTIONS         top
           Selection criteria can be: terminal, user, pid, command.  The
           options below may be used to ensure correct interpretation.
           -t, --tty tty
                  The next expression is a terminal (tty or pty).
           -u, --user user
                  The next expression is a username.
           -p, --pid pid
                  The next expression is a process ID number.
           -c, --command command
                  The next expression is a command name.
           --ns pid
                  Match the processes that belong to the same namespace as
                  pid.
           --nslist ns,...
                  list which namespaces will be considered for the --ns
                  option.  Available namespaces: ipc, mnt, net, pid, user,
                  uts.
## SIGNALS         top
           The behavior of signals is explained in signal(7) manual page.
## EXAMPLES         top
           snice -c seti -c crack +7
                  +Slow down seti and crack commands.
           skill -KILL -t /dev/pts/*
                  Kill users on PTY devices.
           skill -STOP -u viro -u lm -u davem
                  Stop three users.
