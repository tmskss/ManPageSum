## NAME         top
           git-upload-archive - Send archive back to git-archive
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git upload-archive <repository>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Invoked by git archive --remote and sends a generated archive to
           the other end over the Git protocol.
           This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The
           UI for the protocol is on the git archive side, and the program
           pair is meant to be used to get an archive from a remote
           repository.
## SECURITY         top
           In order to protect the privacy of objects that have been removed
           from history but may not yet have been pruned, git-upload-archive
           avoids serving archives for commits and trees that are not
           reachable from the repository’s refs. However, because
           calculating object reachability is computationally expensive,
           git-upload-archive implements a stricter but easier-to-check set
           of rules:
            1. Clients may request a commit or tree that is pointed to
               directly by a ref. E.g., git archive --remote=origin v1.0.
            2. Clients may request a sub-tree within a commit or tree using
               the ref:path syntax. E.g., git archive --remote=origin
               v1.0:Documentation.
            3. Clients may not use other sha1 expressions, even if the end
               result is reachable. E.g., neither a relative commit like
               master^ nor a literal sha1 like abcd1234 is allowed, even if
               the result is reachable from the refs.
           Note that rule 3 disallows many cases that do not have any
           privacy implications. These rules are subject to change in future
           versions of git, and the server accessed by git archive --remote
           may or may not follow these exact rules.
           If the config option uploadArchive.allowUnreachable is true,
           these rules are ignored, and clients may use arbitrary sha1
           expressions. This is useful if you do not care about the privacy
           of unreachable objects, or if your object database is already
           publicly available for access via non-smart-http.

           This page is part of the git (Git distributed version control
           system) project.  Information about the project can be found at
           ⟨http://git-scm.com/⟩.  If you have a bug report for this manual
           page, see ⟨http://git-scm.com/community⟩.  This page was obtained
           from the project's upstream Git repository

           the date of the most recent commit that was found in the
           repository was 2023-06-22.)  If you discover any rendering
