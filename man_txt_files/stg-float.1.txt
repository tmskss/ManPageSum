## NAME         top
           stg-float - Push patches to the top, even if applied
## SYNOPSIS         top
           stg float [OPTIONS] <patch>...
           stg float [OPTIONS] <-S|--series> <file>
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Push patches to the top, even if applied.
           Float one or more patches to be the topmost applied patches. The
           patches to be floated may currently be either applied or
           unapplied. The necessary pop and push operations will be
           performed to float the named patches. Patches not specified will
           remain applied or unapplied as they were prior to the float
           operation.
## OPTIONS         top
           --noapply
               Reorder patches without reapplying any patches
           -S <file>, --series=<file>
               Rearrange according to a series <file>
           -k, --keep
               Keep the local changes
           --committer-date-is-author-date
               Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
               the author date of the commit as the committer date.
