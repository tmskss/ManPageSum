    MESG(1)                       User Commands                      MESG(1)
## NAME         top
           mesg - display (or do not display) messages from other users
## SYNOPSIS         top
           mesg [option] [n|y]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The mesg utility is invoked by a user to control write access
           others have to the terminal device associated with standard error
           output. If write access is allowed, then programs such as talk(1)
           and write(1) may display messages on the terminal.
           Traditionally, write access is allowed by default. However, as
           users become more conscious of various security risks, there is a
           trend to remove write access by default, at least for the primary
           login shell. To make sure your ttys are set the way you want them
           to be set, mesg should be executed in your login scripts.
           The mesg utility silently exits with error status 2 if not
           executed on a terminal. In this case executing mesg is pointless.
           The command line option --verbose forces mesg to print a warning
           in this situation. This behaviour has been introduced in version
           2.33.
## ARGUMENTS         top
           n
               Disallow messages.
           y
               Allow messages to be displayed.
           If no arguments are given, mesg shows the current message status
           on standard error output.
## OPTIONS         top
           -v, --verbose
               Explain what is being done.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The mesg utility exits with one of the following values:
           0
               Messages are allowed.
           1
               Messages are not allowed.
           >1
               An error has occurred.
## FILES         top
           /dev/[pt]ty*, /dev/pts/[0-9]*
## HISTORY         top
           mesg (I) appears in the UNIX Programmer’s Manual. It used to
           invert the current state with no argument before Version 7 AT&T
           UNIX.
## SEE ALSO         top
           login(1), talk(1), write(1), wall(1), xterm(1)
## REPORTING BUGS         top
