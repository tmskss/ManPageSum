## NAME         top
           uniq - report or omit repeated lines
## SYNOPSIS         top
           uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Filter adjacent matching lines from INPUT (or standard input),
           writing to OUTPUT (or standard output).
           With no options, matching lines are merged to the first
           occurrence.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -c, --count
                  prefix lines by the number of occurrences
           -d, --repeated
                  only print duplicate lines, one for each group
           -D     print all duplicate lines
           --all-repeated[=METHOD]
                  like -D, but allow separating groups with an empty line;
                  METHOD={none(default),prepend,separate}
           -f, --skip-fields=N
                  avoid comparing the first N fields
           --group[=METHOD]
                  show all items, separating groups with an empty line;
                  METHOD={separate(default),prepend,append,both}
           -i, --ignore-case
                  ignore differences in case when comparing
           -s, --skip-chars=N
                  avoid comparing the first N characters
           -u, --unique
                  only print unique lines
           -z, --zero-terminated
                  line delimiter is NUL, not newline
           -w, --check-chars=N
                  compare no more than N characters in lines
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           A field is a run of blanks (usually spaces and/or TABs), then
           non-blank characters.  Fields are skipped before chars.
           Note: 'uniq' does not detect repeated lines unless they are
           adjacent.  You may want to sort the input first, or use 'sort -u'
           without 'uniq'.
