    VAL(1P)                 POSIX Programmer's Manual                VAL(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           val — validate SCCS files (DEVELOPMENT)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           val -
           val [-s] [-m name] [-r SID] [-y type] file...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The val utility shall determine whether the specified file is an
           SCCS file meeting the characteristics specified by the options.
## OPTIONS         top
           The val utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
           that the usage of the '-' operand is not strictly as intended by
           the guidelines (that is, reading options and operands from
           standard input).
           The following options shall be supported:
           -m name   Specify a name, which is compared with the SCCS %M%
                     keyword in file; see get(1p).
           -r SID    Specify a SID (SCCS Identification String), an SCCS
                     delta number. A check shall be made to determine
                     whether the SID is ambiguous (for example, -r 1 is
                     ambiguous because it physically does not exist but
                     implies 1.1, 1.2, and so on, which may exist) or
                     invalid (for example, -r 1.0 or -r 1.1.0 are invalid
                     because neither case can exist as a valid delta
                     number).  If the SID is valid and not ambiguous, a
                     check shall be made to determine whether it actually
                     exists.
           -s        Silence the diagnostic message normally written to
                     standard output for any error that is detected while
                     processing each named file on a given command line.
           -y type   Specify a type, which shall be compared with the SCCS
                     %Y% keyword in file; see get(1p).
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operands shall be supported:
           file      A pathname of an existing SCCS file. If exactly one
                     file operand appears, and it is '-', the standard input
                     shall be read: each line shall be independently
                     processed as if it were a command line argument list.
                     (However, the line is not subjected to any of the shell
                     word expansions, such as parameter expansion or quote
                     removal.)
## STDIN         top
           The standard input shall be a text file used only when the file
           operand is specified as '-'.
## INPUT FILES         top
           Any SCCS files processed shall be files of an unspecified format.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           val:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments and input files).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error, and informative messages written to
                     standard output.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The standard output shall consist of informative messages about
           either:
            1. Each file processed
            2. Each command line read from standard input
           If the standard input is not used, for each file operand yielding
           a discrepancy, the output line shall have the following format:
               "%s: %s\n", <pathname>, <unspecified string>
           If the standard input is used, for each input line yielding a
           discrepancy, the output shall have the following format:
               "%s\n\n %s: %s\n", <input>, <pathname>, <unspecified string>
           where <input> is the input line minus its terminating <newline>.
## STDERR         top
           Not used.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The 8-bit code returned by val shall be a disjunction of the
           possible errors; that is, it can be interpreted as a bit string
           where set bits are interpreted as follows:
           0x80   =   Missing file argument.
           0x40   =   Unknown or duplicate option.
           0x20   =   Corrupted SCCS file.
           0x10   =   Cannot open file or file not SCCS.
           0x08   =   SID is invalid or ambiguous.
           0x04   =   SID does not exist.
           0x02   =   %Y%, -y mismatch.
           0x01   =   %M%, -m mismatch.
           Note that val can process two or more files on a given command
           line and can process multiple command lines (when reading the
           standard input). In these cases an aggregate code shall be
           returned: a logical OR of the codes generated for each command
           line and file processed.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           Since the val exit status sets the 0x80 bit, shell applications
           checking "$?" cannot tell if it terminated due to a missing file
           argument or receipt of a signal.
## EXAMPLES         top
           In a directory with three SCCS files—s.x (of t type ``text''),
           s.y, and s.z (a corrupted file)—the following command could
           produce the output shown:
               val - <<EOF
               -y source s.x
               -m y s.y
               s.z
               EOF
               -y source s.x
                   s.x: %Y%, -y mismatch
               s.z
                   s.z: corrupted SCCS file
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
