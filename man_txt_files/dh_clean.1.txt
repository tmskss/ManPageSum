## NAME         top
           dh_clean - clean up package build directories
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dh_clean [debhelper options] [-k] [-d] [-Xitem] [path ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dh_clean is a debhelper program that is responsible for cleaning
           up.  It should be the last step of the clean target and other
           debhelper commands generally assume that dh_clean will clean up
           after them.
           It removes the package build directories, and removes some other
           files including debian/files, and any detritus left behind by
           other debhelper commands. It also removes common files that
           should not appear in a Debian diff:
             #*# *~ DEADJOE *.orig *.rej *.SUMS TAGS .deps/* *.P *-stamp
           It does not run "make clean" to clean up after the build process.
           Use dh_auto_clean(1) to do things like that.
## FILES         top
           debian/clean
               Can list other paths to be removed.
               Note that directories listed in this file must end with a
               trailing slash.  Any content in these directories will be
               removed as well.
               Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
               documented in debhelper(7).
## OPTIONS         top
           -k, --keep
               This is deprecated, use dh_prep(1) instead.
               The option is removed in compat 12.
           -d, --dirs-only
               Only clean the package build directories, do not clean up any
               other files at all.
           -Xitem --exclude=item
               Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename
               from being deleted, even if they would normally be deleted.
               You may use this option multiple times to build up a list of
               things to exclude.
           path ...
               Delete these paths too.
               Note that directories passed as arguments must end with a
               trailing slash.  Any content in these directories will be
               removed as well.
