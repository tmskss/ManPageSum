## NAME         top
           irqtop - utility to display kernel interrupt information
## SYNOPSIS         top
           irqtop [options]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Display kernel interrupt counter information in top(1) style
           view.
           The default output is subject to change. So whenever possible,
           you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts. Always
           explicitly define expected columns by using --output.
## OPTIONS         top
           -o, --output list
               Specify which output columns to print. Use --help to get a
               list of all supported columns. The default list of columns
               may be extended if list is specified in the format +list.
           -c, --cpu-stat mode
               Show per-cpu statistics by specified mode. Available modes
               are: auto, enable, disable. The default option auto detects
               the width of window, then shows the per-cpu statistics if the
               width of window is large enough to show a full line of
               statistics.
           -C, --cpu-list list
               Specify cpus in list format to show.
           -d, --delay seconds
               Update interrupt output every seconds intervals.
           -s, --sort column
               Specify sort criteria by column name. See --help output to
               get column names. The sort criteria may be changes in
               interactive mode.
           -S, --softirq
               Show softirqs information.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## INTERACTIVE MODE KEY COMMANDS         top
           i
               sort by short irq name or number field
           t
               sort by total count of interrupts (the default)
           d
               sort by delta count of interrupts
           n
               sort by long descriptive name field
           q Q
               stop updates and exit program
