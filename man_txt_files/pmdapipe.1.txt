## NAME         top
           pmdapipe - command output capture performance metrics domain
           agent (PMDA)
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pmdapipe [-c configfile] [-d domain] [-l
           logfile] [-m memory]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmdapipe is a configurable command output monitoring Performance
           Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA).  It can be seen as analogous to a
           restricted shell, where options can be passed to preset commands,
           and each line of their output is converted into a performance
           event.  These events can be consumed by client tools like
           pmval(1).
           The pipe PMDA exports both event-style metrics reflecting
           timestamped event records for text-oriented command output, as
           well as the more orthodox sample-style metrics such as event
           counts and throughput size values.
           The PMDA is configured via a configfile which contains one line
           for each process from which output can be captured, as described
           in the ``CONFIGURATION'' section below.
           A brief description of the pmdapipe command line options follows:
           -c   specifies an alternate configuration file for the PMDA.  By
                default, a file named $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pipe.conf and any
                files below the $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pipe.conf.d/ directory are
                used.
           -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
                number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
                domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
                and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
                on all hosts.
           -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                pipe.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
                pmdapipe is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
                file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
                to the standard error instead.
           -m   Limit the physical memory used by the PMDA to buffer event
                records to maxsize bytes.  As log events arrive at the PMDA,
                they must be buffered until individual client tools request
                the next batch since their previous batch of events.  The
                default maximum is 2 megabytes.
## CONFIGURATION         top
           The set of allowed pipe commands is configured by simple text
           file(s).  The format is a single line for each command followed
           by an optional access control section.
           Blank lines and comments are permitted (even encouraged) in the
           configuration file.  A comment begins with a ``#'' character and
           finishes at the end of the line.
           Each command configuration line is of the form:
                  instance username command options
           Where,
           instance
                  is a string identifying the pipe command, also exported as
                  the metric instance identifier.
           username
                  is the name of the user account under which the command
                  should run (e.g. "root")
           command
                  is the path to the binary which will be run to generate
                  piped output
           options
                  is an optional space-separated list of parameters to pass
                  to the command
                         This options list may contain numeric parameters
                         prefixed by the dollar-sign, and these will be
                         substituted with user-supplied values at the time
                         the command is run (similar to shell parameter
                         substitution).
           Parameters are passed as a single space-separated or comma-
           separated string to the pipe.firehose metric, using the
           pmStore(3) interface.  The pmval command provides store access
           via its -x option.  User-supplied parameters are restricted to
           containing alphanumeric characters.
           The access control section of the file must start with a line of
           the form:
           [access]
           Leading and trailing whitespace may appear around and within the
           brackets and the case of the access keyword is ignored.  No other
           text may appear on the line except a trailing comment.
           Following this line, the remainder of the configuration file
           should contain lines that allow or disallow use of commands from
           particular users or groups.
           User names and group names will be verified using the local
           /etc/passwd and /etc/groups files (or an alternative directory
           service), using the getpwent(3) and getgrent(3) routines.
           Access for users or groups are allowed or disallowed by
           specifying statements of the form:
                  allow user username : instance
                  disallow user username : instance
                  allow group groupname : instance
                  disallow group groupname : instance
           The username and groupname names will be verified using the local
           /etc/passwd and /etc/groups files (or an alternative directory
           service), using the getpwent(3) and getgrent(3) routines.
           The wildcard ``*'' can be used to refer to all instance names.
## INSTALLATION         top
           If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
           pipe performance metrics, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe
                # ./Install
           This is an interactive installation process which prompts for
           each log file path to be monitored (or command to be run), a
           metric instance name to identify it, and whether access should be
           restricted (refer to the -x option to pmval(1) for further
           details).
           If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:
                # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe
                # ./Remove
           pmdapipe is launched by pmcd and should never be executed
           directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd when the
           agent is installed or removed.
## EXAMPLES         top
           Following is a simple example of pmdapipe configuration and use
           of the pipe metrics to run the btrace command, by user bob:
                bob> cat $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pipe.conf
                # instance      user      command
                rw_syscalls     root      perf script rw-by-file $1
                bdev_trace      root      btrace -w $1 /dev/$2
                [access]
                allow user bob : *;
                allow user jane : bdev_trace;
                allow group perf : rw_syscalls;
                bob> pmval -i bdev_trace -x '5 sda' pipe.firehose

## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
