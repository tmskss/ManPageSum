## NAME         top
           git-web--browse - Git helper script to launch a web browser
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git web--browse [<options>] (<URL>|<file>)...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           This script tries, as much as possible, to display the URLs and
           FILEs that are passed as arguments, as HTML pages in new tabs on
           an already opened web browser.
           The following browsers (or commands) are currently supported:
           •   firefox (this is the default under X Window when not using
               KDE)
           •   iceweasel
           •   seamonkey
           •   iceape
           •   chromium (also supported as chromium-browser)
           •   google-chrome (also supported as chrome)
           •   konqueror (this is the default under KDE, see Note about
               konqueror below)
           •   opera
           •   w3m (this is the default outside graphical environments)
           •   elinks
           •   links
           •   lynx
           •   dillo
           •   open (this is the default under Mac OS X GUI)
           •   start (this is the default under MinGW)
           •   cygstart (this is the default under Cygwin)
           •   xdg-open
           Custom commands may also be specified.
## OPTIONS         top
           -b <browser>, --browser=<browser>
               Use the specified browser. It must be in the list of
               supported browsers.
           -t <browser>, --tool=<browser>
               Same as above.
           -c <conf.var>, --config=<conf.var>
               CONF.VAR is looked up in the Git config files. If it’s set,
               then its value specifies the browser that should be used.
## CONFIGURATION VARIABLES         top
       CONF.VAR (from -c option) and web.browser
           The web browser can be specified using a configuration variable
           passed with the -c (or --config) command-line option, or the
           web.browser configuration variable if the former is not used.
       browser.<tool>.path
           You can explicitly provide a full path to your preferred browser
           by setting the configuration variable browser.<tool>.path. For
           example, you can configure the absolute path to firefox by
           setting browser.firefox.path. Otherwise, git web--browse assumes
           the tool is available in PATH.
       browser.<tool>.cmd
           When the browser, specified by options or configuration
           variables, is not among the supported ones, then the
           corresponding browser.<tool>.cmd configuration variable will be
           looked up. If this variable exists then git web--browse will
           treat the specified tool as a custom command and will use a shell
           eval to run the command with the URLs passed as arguments.
## NOTE ABOUT KONQUEROR         top
           When konqueror is specified by a command-line option or a
           configuration variable, we launch kfmclient to try to open the
           HTML man page on an already opened konqueror in a new tab if
           possible.
           For consistency, we also try such a trick if
           browser.konqueror.path is set to something like
           A_PATH_TO/konqueror. That means we will try to launch
           A_PATH_TO/kfmclient instead.
           If you really want to use konqueror, then you can use something
           like the following:
                       [web]
                               browser = konq
                       [browser "konq"]
                               cmd = A_PATH_TO/konqueror
       Note about git-config --global
           Note that these configuration variables should probably be set
           using the --global flag, for example like this:
               $ git config --global web.browser firefox
           as they are probably more user specific than repository specific.
           See git-config(1) for more information about this.
