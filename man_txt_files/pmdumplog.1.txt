    PMLOGDUMP(1)             General Commands Manual            PMLOGDUMP(1)
## NAME         top
           pmlogdump, pmdumplog - dump internal details of a performance
           metrics archive log
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pmlogdump [-adehIilLmMrstxzV?]  [-n pmnsfile] [-S starttime] [-T
           endtime] [-Z timezone] archive [metricname ...]
           pmlogdump [-v file]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pmlogdump dumps assorted control, metadata, index and state
           information from the files of a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
           archive log.  The archive log has the base name archive and must
           have been previously created using pmlogger(1).
           Historically, pmlogdump was known as pmdumplog but the latter
           name is not consistent with the other PCP commands that operate
           on PCP archives, so pmlogdump is preferred, however pmdumplog is
           maintained for backwards compatibility.
           Normally pmlogdump operates on the distributed Performance
           Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is specified
           an alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file pmnsfile.
           If any metricname arguments appear, the report will be restricted
           to information relevant to the named performance metrics.  If
           metricname is a non-leaf node in the namespace (see PMNS(5)),
           then pmlogdump will recursively descend the archive's namespace
           and report on all leaf nodes.
           Command line options control the specific information to be
           reported.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -a, --all
                Report almost everything, i.e. the flags -d, -i, -L, -m, -s
                and -t.  The optional help text (-h) and label metadata
                strings (-e) are not reported by default.
           -d, --descs
                Display the metadata and descriptions for those performance
                metrics that appear at least once in the archive: see
                pmLookupDesc(3) for more details on the metadata describing
                metrics.
           -e, --labelsets
                Display the label metadata if it is present in the archive.
                See pmLookupLabels(3) for more details on the label metadata
                hierarchy associated with metrics.
           -h, --helptext
                Display metric and instance domain help text if present in
                the archive.  See pmLookupText(3) for more details on the
                help text associated with metrics.
           -i, --insts
                Display the instance domains, and any variations in their
                instance members over the duration of the archive: see
                pmGetInDom(3) for more details on instance domains.
           -I, --on-disk-insts
                Display the on-disk instance domains, which may use a
                different format and encoding than the one visible above the
                Performance Metrics Programming Interface (PMAPI) when using
                pmGetInDom(3) and related routines.  The on-disk format is
                only of interest when investigating the internal structure
                of PCP archives.
           -l, --label
                Dump the archive label, showing the log format version, the
                time and date for the start and (current) end of the
                archive, and the host from which the performance metrics
                values were collected.
           -L   Like -l, just a little more verbose.
           -m, --metrics
                Print the values for the performance metrics from the
                archive.  This is the default display option.
                Metrics without an instance domain are reported as:
                  [timestamp] metric-id (metric-name): value1 value2
                Metrics with an instance domain are reported as:
                  [timestamp] metric-id (metric-name):
                      inst [internal-id or "external-id"] value1 value2
                The timestamp is only reported for the first metric in a
                group of metrics sharing the same timestamp.
           -M, --markrecs
                If no metricname is specified then <mark> records are
                reported when they are found in the archive.  If metricname
                arguments are specified, then <mark> records are not
                reported by default.  The -M option forces <mark> records to
                be reported, even when metricname arguments are specified.
                <mark> records are inserted into a PCP archive log by
                pmlogger(1), pmlogextract(1), and similar tools to indicate
                a temporal discontinuity in the time-series of metric
                values.
           -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
                Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5))
                from the file pmnsfile.
           -r, --reverse
                Process the archive in reverse order, from most recent to
                oldest recorded metric values.
           -s, --sizes
                Report the size in bytes of each physical record in the
                archive.
           -S starttime, --start=starttime
                When using the -m option, the report will be restricted to
                those records logged at or after starttime.  Refer to
                PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the syntax for
                starttime.
           -t   Dump the temporal index that is used to provide accelerated
                access to large archive files.
                The integrity of the index will also be checked.  If the
                index is found to be corrupted, the ``*.index'' file can be
                renamed or removed and the archive will still be accessible,
                however retrievals may take longer without the index.  Note
                however that a corrupted temporal index is usually
                indicative of a deeper malaise that may infect all files in
                a PCP archive.
           -T endtime, --finish=endtime
                When using the -m option, the report will be restricted to
                those records logged before or at endtime.  Refer to
                PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the syntax for
                endtime.
           -v file
                Verbose mode.  Dump the records from a physical archive file
                in hexadecimal format.  In this case file is the name of a
                single file, usually a basename (as would otherwise appear
                as the archive command line argument), concatenated with
                ``.'' followed by one of meta (the metadata), index (the
                temporal index), or a digit (one of the volumes of metric
                values).
                Use of -v precludes the use of all other options and
                arguments.
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -x   Extended timestamp reporting format that includes the day of
                the week, day of the month, month and year in addition to
                the (default) hours, minutes and seconds time.  This is
                useful for archives that span multiple days.
                A second -x option will also report the timestamp as an
                offset from the start of the archive in units of seconds.
                This is useful in conjunction with debug diagnostics from
                the archive handling routines in libpcp.
                A third -x option will also report the timestamp in
                ``Epoch'' format (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).
           -z, --hostzone
                Change the timezone to the local timezone at the host that
                is the source of the performance metrics, as specified in
                the label record of the archive log.
           -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
                By default, pmlogdump reports the time of day according to
                the local timezone on the system where pmlogdump is run.
                The -Z option changes the timezone to timezone in the format
                of the environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## FILES         top
           $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/<hostname>
                Default directory for PCP archives containing performance
                metric values collected from the host hostname.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
