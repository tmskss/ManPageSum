    COLCRT(1)                     User Commands                    COLCRT(1)
## NAME         top
           colcrt - filter nroff output for CRT previewing
## SYNOPSIS         top
           colcrt [options] [file ...]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           colcrt provides virtual half-line and reverse line feed sequences
           for terminals without such capability, and on which overstriking
           is destructive. Half-line characters and underlining (changed to
           dashing `-') are placed on new lines in between the normal output
           lines.
## OPTIONS         top
           -, --no-underlining
               Suppress all underlining. This option is especially useful
               for previewing allboxed tables from tbl(1).
           -2, --half-lines
               Causes all half-lines to be printed, effectively double
               spacing the output. Normally, a minimal space output format
               is used which will suppress empty lines. The program never
               suppresses two consecutive empty lines, however. The -2
               option is useful for sending output to the line printer when
               the output contains superscripts and subscripts which would
               otherwise be partially invisible.
           -h, --help
               Display help text and exit.
           -V, --version
               Print version and exit.
## HISTORY         top
           The colcrt command appeared in 3.0BSD.
## BUGS         top
           Should fold underlines onto blanks even with the - option so that
           a true underline character would show.
           Can’t back up more than 102 lines.
           General overstriking is lost; as a special case '|' overstruck
           with '-' or underline becomes '+'.
           Lines are trimmed to 132 characters.
           Some provision should be made for processing superscripts and
           subscripts in documents which are already double-spaced.
## EXAMPLES         top
           A typical use of colcrt would be:
              tbl exum2.n | nroff -ms | colcrt - | more
## SEE ALSO         top
           col(1), more(1), nroff(1), troff(1), ul(1)
