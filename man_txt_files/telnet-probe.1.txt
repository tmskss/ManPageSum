    TELNET-PROBE(1)          General Commands Manual         TELNET-PROBE(1)
## NAME         top
           telnet-probe - lightweight telnet-like port probe
## SYNOPSIS         top
           $PCP_BINADM_DIR/telnet-probe [-cv?]  host port
## DESCRIPTION         top
           telnet-probe allows the pmdashping(1) daemons to establish
           connections to arbitrary local and remote service-providing
           daemons so that response time and service availability
           information can be obtained.
           The required host and port number arguments have the same meaning
           as their telnet(1) equivalents.
           The -c option causes telnet-probe to perform a connect(2) only.
           This skips the read(2) and write(2) exercise that would otherwise
           be done after connecting (see below).
           Once the telnet connection has been established, telnet-probe
           reads from stdin until end-of-file, and writes all the input data
           to the telnet connection.  Next, telnet-probe will read from the
           telnet connection until end-of-file, discarding whatever data it
           receives.  Then telnet-probe exits.
           To operate successfully, the input passed via telnet-probe to the
           remote service must be sufficient to cause the remote service to
           close the connection when the last line of input has been
           processed, e.g. ending with ``quit'' when probing SMTP on port
           25.
           By default telnet-probe will not produce any output, unless there
           is an error in which case a diagnostic message can be displayed
           (in verbose mode only) and the exit status will be non-zero
           indicating a failure.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -c   Connect only, do not read or write.
           -v   Enable verbose mode.
           -?   Display usage message and exit.
## DIAGNOSTICS         top
           If telnet-probe succeeds, then 0 will be returned.  If the
           attempt to establish a connection fails or is terminated, then a
           non-zero exit status is returned.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
