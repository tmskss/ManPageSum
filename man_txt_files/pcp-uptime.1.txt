## NAME         top
           pcp-uptime - tell how long the system has been running
## SYNOPSIS         top
           pcp [pcp options] uptime [-V?]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           pcp-uptime gives a one line display of the following information.
           The current time, how long the system has been running, how many
           users are currently logged on, and the system load averages for
           the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
           When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
           -O/--origin, -Z/--timezone and several other pcp options become
           indirectly available.
## OPTIONS         top
           The available command line options are:
           -V, --version
                Display version number and exit.
           -?, --help
                Display usage message and exit.
## NOTES         top
           pcp-uptime is inspired by the uptime(1) command and aims to be
           command line and output compatible with it.
## PCP ENVIRONMENT         top
           Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
           parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
           installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
           for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
           specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
           pcp.conf(5).
           For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
           pmGetOptions(3).
