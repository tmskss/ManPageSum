    GIT-MKTREE(1)                  Git Manual                  GIT-MKTREE(1)
## NAME         top
           git-mktree - Build a tree-object from ls-tree formatted text
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git mktree [-z] [--missing] [--batch]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Reads standard input in non-recursive ls-tree output format, and
           creates a tree object. The order of the tree entries is
           normalized by mktree so pre-sorting the input is not required.
           The object name of the tree object built is written to the
           standard output.
## OPTIONS         top
           -z
               Read the NUL-terminated ls-tree -z output instead.
           --missing
               Allow missing objects. The default behaviour (without this
               option) is to verify that each tree entry’s sha1 identifies
               an existing object. This option has no effect on the
               treatment of gitlink entries (aka "submodules") which are
               always allowed to be missing.
           --batch
               Allow building of more than one tree object before exiting.
               Each tree is separated by a single blank line. The final
               new-line is optional. Note - if the -z option is used, lines
               are terminated with NUL.
