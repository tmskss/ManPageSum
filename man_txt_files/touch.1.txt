## NAME         top
           touch - change file timestamps
## SYNOPSIS         top
           touch [OPTION]... FILE...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the
           current time.
           A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c
           or -h is supplied.
           A FILE argument string of - is handled specially and causes touch
           to change the times of the file associated with standard output.
           Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
           options too.
           -a     change only the access time
           -c, --no-create
                  do not create any files
           -d, --date=STRING
                  parse STRING and use it instead of current time
           -f     (ignored)
           -h, --no-dereference
                  affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file
                  (useful only on systems that can change the timestamps of
                  a symlink)
           -m     change only the modification time
           -r, --reference=FILE
                  use this file's times instead of current time
           -t STAMP
                  use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time
           --time=WORD
                  change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use:
                  equivalent to -a WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m
           --help display this help and exit
           --version
                  output version information and exit
           Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date
           formats.
## DATE STRING         top
           The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date
           string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29
           16:21:42" or even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain
           items indicating calendar date, time of day, time zone, day of
           week, relative time, relative date, and numbers.  An empty string
           indicates the beginning of the day.  The date string format is
           more complex than is easily documented here but is fully
           described in the info documentation.
