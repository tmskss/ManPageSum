## NAME         top
           git-quiltimport - Applies a quilt patchset onto the current
           branch
## SYNOPSIS         top
           git quiltimport [--dry-run | -n] [--author <author>] [--patches <dir>]
                           [--series <file>] [--keep-non-patch]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           Applies a quilt patchset onto the current Git branch, preserving
           the patch boundaries, patch order, and patch descriptions present
           in the quilt patchset.
           For each patch the code attempts to extract the author from the
           patch description. If that fails it falls back to the author
           specified with --author. If the --author flag was not given the
           patch description is displayed and the user is asked to
           interactively enter the author of the patch.
           If a subject is not found in the patch description the patch name
           is preserved as the 1 line subject in the Git description.
## OPTIONS         top
           -n, --dry-run
               Walk through the patches in the series and warn if we cannot
               find all of the necessary information to commit a patch. At
               the time of this writing only missing author information is
               warned about.
           --author Author Name <Author Email>
               The author name and email address to use when no author
               information can be found in the patch description.
           --patches <dir>
               The directory to find the quilt patches.
               The default for the patch directory is patches or the value
               of the $QUILT_PATCHES environment variable.
           --series <file>
               The quilt series file.
               The default for the series file is <patches>/series or the
               value of the $QUILT_SERIES environment variable.
           --keep-non-patch
               Pass -b flag to git mailinfo (see git-mailinfo(1)).
