    TYPE(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               TYPE(1P)
## PROLOG         top
           This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
           Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
           corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
           or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
## NAME         top
           type — write a description of command type
## SYNOPSIS         top
           type name...
## DESCRIPTION         top
           The type utility shall indicate how each argument would be
           interpreted if used as a command name.
## OPTIONS         top
           None.
## OPERANDS         top
           The following operand shall be supported:
           name      A name to be interpreted.
## STDIN         top
           Not used.
## INPUT FILES         top
           None.
## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES         top
           The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
           type:
           LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                     variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                     Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                     Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                     internationalization variables used to determine the
                     values of locale categories.)
           LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                     of all the other internationalization variables.
           LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                     sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                     example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                     characters in arguments).
           LC_MESSAGES
                     Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                     format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                     standard error.
           NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                     processing of LC_MESSAGES.
           PATH      Determine the location of name, as described in the
                     Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 8,
                     Environment Variables.
## ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS         top
           Default.
## STDOUT         top
           The standard output of type contains information about each
           operand in an unspecified format. The information provided
           typically identifies the operand as a shell built-in, function,
           alias, or keyword, and where applicable, may display the
           operand's pathname.
## STDERR         top
           The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
## OUTPUT FILES         top
           None.
## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION         top
           None.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           The following exit values shall be returned:
            0    Successful completion.
           >0    An error occurred.
## CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS         top
           Default.
           The following sections are informative.
## APPLICATION USAGE         top
           Since type must be aware of the contents of the current shell
           execution environment (such as the lists of commands, functions,
           and built-ins processed by hash), it is always provided as a
           shell regular built-in. If it is called in a separate utility
           execution environment, such as one of the following:
               nohup type writer
               find . -type f | xargs type
           it might not produce accurate results.
## EXAMPLES         top
           None.
## RATIONALE         top
           None.
## FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
           None.
