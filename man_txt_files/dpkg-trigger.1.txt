## NAME         top
           dpkg-trigger - a package trigger utility
## SYNOPSIS         top
           dpkg-trigger [option...] trigger-name
           dpkg-trigger [option...] command
## DESCRIPTION         top
           dpkg-trigger is a tool to explicitly activate triggers and check
           for its support on the running dpkg.
           This can be used by maintainer scripts in complex and conditional
           situations where the file triggers, or the declarative activate
           triggers control file directive, are insufficiently rich. It can
           also be used for testing and by system administrators (but note
           that the triggers won't actually be run by dpkg-trigger).
           Unrecognized trigger name syntaxes are an error for dpkg-trigger.
## COMMANDS         top
           --check-supported
               Check if the running dpkg supports triggers (usually called
               from a postinst). Will exit 0 if a triggers-capable dpkg has
               run, or 1 with an error message to stderr if not. Normally,
               however, it is better just to activate the desired trigger
               with dpkg-trigger.
           -?, --help
               Show the usage message and exit.
           --version
               Show the version and exit.
## OPTIONS         top
           --admindir=dir
               Change the location of the dpkg database.  Defaults to
               /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg if DPKG_ADMINDIR has not been set.
           --root=directory
               Set the root directory to directory, which sets the
               administrative directory to
               «directory/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» (since dpkg 1.21.0).
           --by-package=package
               Override trigger awaiter (normally set by dpkg through the
               DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE environment variable of the
               maintainer scripts, naming the package to which the script
               belongs, and this will be used by default).
           --no-await
               This option arranges that the calling package T (if any) need
               not await the processing of this trigger; the interested
               package(s) I, will not be added to T's trigger processing
               awaited list and T's status is unchanged.  T may be
               considered installed even though I may not yet have processed
               the trigger.
           --await
               This option does the inverse of --no-await (since dpkg
               1.17.21).  If the interested package has declared a “noawait”
               directive, then this option will not be effective.  It is
               currently the default behavior.
           --no-act
               Just test, do not actually change anything.
## EXIT STATUS         top
           0   The requested action was successfully performed.  Or a check
               or assertion command returned true.
           1   A check or assertion command returned false.
           2   Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
               usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to
               the database, memory allocations, etc.
## ENVIRONMENT         top
           DPKG_ROOT
               If set and the --root option has not been specified, it will
               be used as the filesystem root directory (since dpkg 1.21.0).
           DPKG_ADMINDIR
               If set and the --admindir option has not been specified, it
               will be used as the dpkg data directory.
           DPKG_DEBUG
               Sets the debug mask (since dpkg 1.21.10) from an octal value.
               The currently accepted flags are described in the dpkg
               --debug option, but not all these flags might have an effect
               on this program.
           DPKG_COLORS
               Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
               accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.
