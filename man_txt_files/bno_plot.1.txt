    BNO_PLOT(1)                                                  BNO_PLOT(1)
## NAME         top
           bno_plot - generate interactive 3D plot of IO blocks and sizes
## SYNOPSIS         top
           bno_plot [ -h | --help ]
                    [ -v | --verbose ]
                    [ -K | --keys-below ]
                    [ <file...> ]
## DESCRIPTION         top
           bno_plot is a visualization tool for the block layer IO tracing
           tool called blktrace(8).  As noted in its documentation, blktrace
           is a block layer IO tracing mechanism which provides detailed
           information about request queue operations up to user space.
           bno_plot utilizes gnuplot to generate a 3D plot of the block
           number output from btt.  If no <files> are specified, it will
           utilize all files generated after btt was run with -B blknos
           (meaning: all files of the form blknos*[rw].dat).
           The -K option forces bno_plot to put the keys below the graph.
           If it is not specified, all keys for input files are put in the
           upper right corner of the graph. If the number of devices exceed
           10, then bno_plot will automatically push the keys under the
           graph.
           To use this utility, the gnuplot package needs to be installed.
           To exit the plotter, enter 'quit' or ^D at the 'gnuplot> '
           prompt.
## AUTHORS         top
           bno_plot was written by Alan D. Brunelle.  This man page was
           created from the blktrace documentation by Bas Zoetekouw.
